I'm 18, and I suffer from Post Traumatic Stress \nDisorder. If you don't know how it works or feels, it's like walking around \ninside a cage 24/7. You constantly relive your traumatic experience over \nand over and over again, and you feel like you're going crazy. You get \nirritated/angry a lot easier. The smallest things will set you off. You \nhallucinate really bad. And at some point in the day you WILL end up having \na mental breakdown. You almost involuntarily shut yourself out from the \nrest of the world. You don't want to be around people, even though being \nsocially active at all times does help to, sort of, dilute it and distract \nyou from your constant feeling of being on the edge. The best way I know \nhow to describe it is it's like constantly feeling like you're about to \nhave a panic attack, but it never comes. It's just a continuous \nuncomfortable feeling. It's a very difficult thing to live with, because \nonce that mental meltdown hits you, you don't know when it's gonna end, or \nif it's even gonna end at all. I've been dealing with this for a little \nunder two years now, and it's just gotten progressively worse with time. At \none point I was so fucking depressed and so low. Honestly, I just wanted to \ndie. At the time, I felt like there was no other way to make this stop. But \nthen I remembered there were people in my life that really needed me, so I \nscratched that. Instead, one day, I had the razor blade in my hand, and I \nstarted cutting myself. Not necessarily out of a self-destruction thing, or \na lack of feeling of self-worth. It was mainly to feel something real. \nBecause a lot of the anger and rage had just kept building up and building \nup, and it was tearing me apart. So turning to the blade was mostly a \npressure-release for me. Then, one day, the stress and the guilt and \neverything else was just becoming way too heavy for me to carry, so I \noverdosed on pain pills. My grandma found me and took me to the hospital. \nThey fed me Ipecac to make me throw all that up. And then they gave me this \nliquid charcoal stuff to help my stomach settle, and I think that was the \nlowest point in my life. I got home and I was angry. I really was. I was \nangry that I had no way to get away from this. So I picked up a pen and \npaper and I started writing my thoughts down. And eventually that turned \ninto songwriting. Songwriting really gave me that voice that I needed. It \ngave me that chance to let that primal scream out, without actually having \nto scream. It was there if I needed it, really. Writing really helped me to \nwrap my head around what I was feeling, and helped me to deal with those \nfeelings a lot easier. \n\n\nListen to me, you are stronger than you know. Nothing on this earth is \nworth going a way for. Nothing on this earth is worth taking your life for, \nunderstand? Not a damn thing. There is ALWAYS a way out. You can pull \nthrough whatever it is that you're going through. Whether it be school, or \ngrowing up in a very dark household, y'know whatever it is. There is always \na light at the end of the tunnel. You have to hang in there, okay? Because \nI promise that everything after this is amazing. You may not see it now, \nbut you will.

So usually I try to ignore it and go on with \nlife but sometimes it makes everything else invisible because its so loud. \nSooo... I try to make them leave eachother alone but in the end I get \nyelled at by both of them and put myself in my corner with my computer \nyelling at them saying they are drunkards who don't need me.

When people cut, feel bad about themselves, or want to \ngive suicide they talk to me because id otn want anyone to die even if I \nsay I hate the person, only considering that words are words not actions.

Soon my my dad and \nhis girlfriend finally split up. but she soon told DHR that my dad was \ndoing drugs , and so me and my two sisters wemt straight to a foster home \nabout 2 days later. my other two sisters went with their aunt. i was scared \namd the foster parents were horrible. so we went to a group home and it was \nok. we then moved in with our grandmother, and thats when things started \ngetting bad. i got so depressed and i changed so much. i had a couple \nfriends and we hung out and what not, but then my dad came back into my \nlife , and we visted him on weekends. he told my grandmother that i could \nnot hang out with any of my friends, because they were not the religion he \nwas. so i started staying in my room all the time. i did nothing. my \ngrandma rarely went out because she was sick so i would be alone a lot. i \ndidn't start self harming until i was about late 13. i was sent to a \nhospital and after i got out we moved back in with our dad, and it was \nhell. my grandmother was not allowed to give us back to him, but she did. \nmy dad. my dad never even took me to one therapist appointment and he made \nme come off my medicine abruptly. I was getting EVEN worse and had another \nhospital trip. my dad had a wife even before my mom, but she came back into \nhis life and moved in with us. she paid for almost everything because my \ndad spent his money in pills. one night i woke up hearing my step mom \nyelling because my dad was in my two sisters bunk bed doing the nasty with \nhis recent ex girlfriend (not the one that beat me). we saw her a lot. my \ndad gave her money even when us kids needed it. she was on drugs and it was \nweird seeing her like that. i felt bad for her. so after that incident my \naunt came and got us kids and about two weeks later his ex came up \nmurdered. and it happened in my dads house. and he was the suspect. she was \ncut up and her body was behind a store. my dad is in jail and has been for \na couple of months. i dont know if he did it but i think he knew something \nabout it. i will never ever forgive him. she was a beautiful woman. she was \nmean to me often and i hate myself for it. if i could just go back in \ntime..she was beat my dad so many times and even landed in the hospital \nonce. i will never forgive him for any of it. after all this occurred i had \nanother hospital trip and not long after, i overdosed on my aunts pills \n(whom i live with now). i was in icu for about 3 days and i literally \nalmsot died. i had a seizure, and i wasnt breathing for a while. i didnt go \nto the hospital to get treatment becaudr i thought i learned my lesson but \ni should hae because i still wamt to die. and i wish my overdose would have \nworked. i try to be positive and im getting a little better. i have a \ntherapist now and we are working on me getting over my past and becoming \nbetter (: sorry this was so long and no one probably cares but whatever\ufeff"], "a.wild. thing": [":( this made me cry!!!

I'm digressing. \nThis wasn't supposed to show my weaknesses, and I didn't mean to let you \nknow that, but I think it could help maybe. \nThe point was: please, don't leave us. Keep strong. As I usually say, \"chin \nup. Back straight. Left, right, left, right. Keep walking darling, I'm here \nto lift you when you fall.\" \nAnd I know I'm not the only one that cares. I'm sure there are more people \nout there praying you not to self-harm. I'm sure they plead you not to keep \nthinking you're ugly. They ask you to smile and forget everything. To keep \ngoing even if he/she broke your heart. To keep strong, even if someone is \nabout to kill you from the inside. Even if you feel worthless. Even if you \nfeel you're invisible sometimes, you can go through it, I promise. You can. \nBut I won't let you be alone. \nTalk to me whenever you want. I'm here for you. Promise. Esimorp (for those \nwho don't believe in promises)\nTalk to someone else if you don't trust me. I care. And I want you to be \nfine. I'll listen and try my best to help. Even though I'm far away from \nyou.\nJust know that you are the whole world to someone. Don't let them crying in \nyour grave. Don't let them cry on your clothes pleading for your scent to \nnever disappear. Don't leave them alone. Don't let yourself ruin someone's \nlife, even if you think no one cares.\nThings will get better. They will change. It will be all right. Promise. \nJust go ahead. You're brave enough. Don't give up. \nYes, it's a big world. You may think you're no one. But you're as big as \nthe world in someone's heart. They won't find another person to fill your \nempty space.\nYou have me. Whenever you need me.\nI love you, I really do.\nDon't give in. \nAnd then I thought maybe you don't need someone to talk to. Maybe you need \nmotivation to keep fighting. So I won't keep praying you to stay. I'll give \nyou reasons to. But you need to share in this world one more day. Only one. \nThen you decide.\nSmile to people. \nSay good morning/evening/afternoon to people in the street. \nHelp someone you think they need a hand without expecting nothing in change.\nPet a dog/cat and find him/her a home \nWrite down what you feel and ask yourself what you would say to a person \nwith that feelings in that situation. \nPlay with a child at the park.\nTalk to someone that seems alone.\nSing/dance/play an instrument without caring if someone sees you.\nListen to music with someone. \nAsk someone to have tea/coffee/hot chocolate with you.\nGo to a caf\u00e9 and watch the people in the street.\nGo to a park and watch the children play. Offer them cookies/sweets/candy \ncotton.\nDraw and paste the pieces of paper in the street. \nCheck \"7 cups of tea\"\nWatch videos/movies/cartoons \nSpend time with someone (even if you don't know that person.)\nTry not to think in those things that make you sad.\nFeel free to do whatever you want to.\nGo to a library and talk to someone.\nMake good art. \nStop in the middle of the block and watch the sky. \nOkay, I'll think about more. \nAfter you feel those experiences, you decide to stay or leave. Hope you \nchoose right. \nI want you to pp me and write down how you felt and what things you did. \nI'll be happy to listen. \nLove you always \n~Luli~ \n\n*Many of you need a reminder.* *I need to remember this too*\n#RePosted\n\nThingsGet Better: http://youtu.be/GTQn9nHYmlk\ufeff"], "Jessica Morales": ["i wish i could just take every pain away that anybody has had to go thro \nand still are and put it in a little box  and just destory it because me \nand a lot of other people have lost wonderful people to this and im tired \nof lousing bad ass people i love everone just the way theay are but the \npeople that love me back are just diapering alex like i said before you are \njust a bad a** person that deserves alot of hugs and rainbows just like \nevery one else i hope that every body can just get thro depression and \n......you know self harm ( im not proud but you know.....) i just want \npeople  to stop judgeing others for how they look act or sound what kind of \nmusic they like  ect.. it is there own darn prerogative if they want to do \nthat it makes them happy what ever floats there boat but any ways sorry for \nthe boring rant if you are stll reading this :3 i hope you and everyone \nelse can get thro this i love you:3   jessica rabit\ufeff"], "itsxmyxlife": ["I love her hair\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ufeff"], "Steph Q": ["aw u r beautiful just the way u are\ufeff"], "lily dietz": ["For the first time in four, almost five, years I can finally say I have \nbeen clean for longer than a month:).

About a year ago I was depressed. Why? Because I had an \nabusive step dad that kept yelling and throwing stuff and he tried to hurt \nme so many times including my mom and my siblings. It all started when I \nwas laying in my bed being scared as ever cuz I had a blade in my hand. I \nwanted it to all end cuz I thought that he would never leave I'm stuck in \nthat he'll house forever. So I did it. I started cutting. But it didn't \nhelp anything it only made me feel worse. So I tried something different. I \ntried to kill myself. I can't say what I did. But it didn't work. Few \nmonths after that my mom finally decided to leave my step dad. We had to \nlive at my grandmas house at the time. Also my mom was pregnant at that \ntime too. I was still depressed for some reason. I didn't say anything. \nAlso I was still cutting. I still wanted to die cuz I didn't see no \nhappiness in the future it was like hell and I couldn't escape from it. \nAfter when my mom had her baby and she got a divorce from him. We got a \nhouse. I was still depressed. But I was cutting less. One day, my mom saw \nmy cuts on my arm. She asked me how and why I do it. I told her everything. \nAnd as soon as she found out about everything I went to therapy they asked \nme if I ever tried to kill myself. I couldn't lie so I said yes. Little did \nI know that they would sent me to a mental hospital. And there forward I \ngot better. I started to smile more laugh more. I never thought that I \nwould be happy again. To this day I'm a whole new different person I'm \nhappy. So yes, things do get better and I'm thankful that I didn't kill \nmyself to find that out. Life is a beautiful gift.

My story starts off with my mom, dad, \nbrother and I moving to Las Vegas. Things got bad my parents would fight \nconstantly and I hated it I tried getting in the middle because I didn't \nwant my dad to hurt my mother. In the end my mom and dad separated and my \ndad took me with him to live with his new girlfriend that he was cheating \nwith. I moved schools and didn't really fit in much I was mostly a loner \nand it sucked I had no friends and I was awkward. At the time I was in \nmiddle school and things weren't going that great at home either. My dad \nand his girlfriend would have fights one time they got put in jail and me \nback at my moms. That next morning I ran away from my moms and went back to \nmy apartment things just were not good and I hated it. My mom and dad had \narranged meetings to have me and my brother visit my dads and moms house on \nthe weekends and I absolutely hated my mom. Before my dad and me moved out \nshe was abusing me she hit me and pulled my hair and held me down in my bed \nso I would go to sleep at night and not go hang out with my dad which I \nfelt safe with he was my safe haven. After a year my dad moved back in with \nmy mother and things were ok tho I didn't want to go back. He then moved \nout on his own with his girlfriend to Colorado and got put in prison for \nreason I wont be saying. After that things got even more worse. After my \nfather left me I got really depressed and didn't want to do anything I \ndidn't want to live. At night I would cry myself to sleep thinking what I \ncould have done different to have my father stay with my family. Things \nslipped away from my hands and all I could do was sit there and watch it \nhappen. I got depressed and locked myself in my room and I didn't care \nabout the world at all I just wanted to die. I thought about suicide but \nnever acted upon it many times I would just cry alone. I felt all alone. \nThen one day I came across anime. It was different and I've heard of it \nbefore but this time I was more interested and wanted to see more of it. I \nstarted to get into anime and it was awesome mind blowing on how the action \nwas. Night after night I would stay up and watch anime all through the \nnight binge watching different anime. It made me happy and excited. Now I'm \ngoing skip a few things because they are not necessary to be in this story. \nMe and my family moved back to California where I was from and got a house. \nWe lived in a good neighborhood and people where much more friendly then \npeople from las Vegas. Ever since I started high school I was in online \nschool and that wasn't good for me because it made me become an introvert. \nI then met this guy online he lived in so cal and i fell in love with him. \nThis is were thing get fucked up. I was always depressed and i was very \ninsecure he kinda made it worse. We dated for about 2 months and things \nweren't going well we did \"stuff\" and to much of that \"stuff\" resulted in \nharmful things i guess you could say. He had problems of his own and had \nmulti personality disorder and wasn't right in the head. I believed \neverything he said and that was where i went wrong. He was a lair and lied \nalot. He broke up with me because i couldn't do the stuff he wanted me to \ndo and i loved him so much so it crushed me almost as much as my father \nleaving me did. I resorted to self harm because of a boy i know its stupid \nbut i did and i felt that that was the only thing that could help the pain. \nAfter a few months i got over the boy tho he would sit in the back of my \nmind taunting me. I was still in love with him. After we broke up i got \ninto trouble online and did some things im not proud of. I got into a few \nonline relationship with guys a lil older then me and a guy who was 10 \nyears older then me. Those never worked out and i thought that i had to \nfind someone to love me. That was not the answer. I needed to love myself \nin order to love someone else whole heartedly. at the beginning of this \nyear my ex the boy i fell in love with online came back to me and we dated \nfor 2 weeks and then he broke up with my because \"his parents found out \nabout the stuff we did\" and blocked me from talking to him. He was lying i \nbelieve like before. I got depressed again and almost resulted back to self \nharm but stoped myself it did not help me anymore and only made things \nworse. But things got better i met some cool people and they made me feel \nbetter about myself. In a midist of all f this there were good things in \n2015 fall i got back regular high school and made some friends i have a \nbest friend now who i love so much shes like a sister to me and i have a bf \nnow that loves me so much. I pushed tho the bad times because i had people \nsupporting me. If you feel absolutely alone just know there are others out \nthere that have gone through the same things as you. Everyday i struggle \nwith bipolar depression and i feel like life hates me and just takes a shit \non me all the time. But i have to know that there are people out there just \nlike me and people that support me in making my life better for me. It \nmakes me push through those tough times and puts a smile on my face when i \ndon't feel like i can do anything. If you have read all of this i thank you \nfor listening to my story im just one of thousands out there who have gone \nthrough so much and seen the bright side to things.

Starting in fourth \ngrade I switched elementary schools. At that point i was leaving a school \nthat I had lots of friends and was happy all the time to a place that it \nwas hard to make friends and people weren't great to me. Starting in about \n5th-6th grade I was mildly bullied by a couple specific people, and even \nfriends of mine at the time brought my self esteem down. In 7th grade i was \nreally excited because I knew I would get to see a bit of my old friends \nagain at the middle school. However, when I got there, I did make new \nfriends, but I still had a lot going on. I had family in and out of the \nhospital from the summer before 7th grade until the summer after 8th. In \nthose two years I got really depressed and couldn't find a positive way to \ndeal with my emotions. I started hiding how I felt from a majority of my \nfriends, and because of people I used to talk to, I was scared that I would \nbe judged or yelled at for sharing my emotions. Finally, in 8th grade I \nmade some friends to help me through it, but it didn't end there. During my \n8th grade year rumors were worse than ever. People spread rumors about me \njudging others, bashing my sexuality,etc., to the point that many of my \nfriends bought into it and left me out to dry. At this current point in \ntime a couple of those friends learned not to pay attention to the rumors, \nbut the people that started them are all still out there, and I still have \nfamily commonly ending up in the hospital for different reasons. Earlier \nthis year someone told the councilor that I wasn't handling my problems \nwell, which got another councilor, and my parents involved, but I am \ngrateful because even though I still don't know how to deal with what I'm \ngoing through, I know to find healthier ways to try and solve my problems.\ufeff"], "Trinity ^-^": ["I felt horrible before I watched this video.

Since I was a kid I would always get bullied \nbecause I wasn't skinny like the other girls or I wasn't pretty enough or \nsmart enough and I'm not really the type of person who lets things like \nthat get to them but after hearing it so often and for several years it \nreally starts to take a toll on you and it gets to a point where you start \nto believe it. I hated myself. I hated being in my own skin. I cried myself \nto sleep so many nights. When my dad walked into my room and saw me crying \nhe asked me what was wrong, I just sat there because I couldn't tell him \nthat his daughter wishes she could be dead. I couldn't do it. I told my \nbest friend and she helped me though it and without her I would most likely \nbe dead. I still have those thoughts from time to time but I'm never \nletting it take control of me like it did before.
