You are thinking too much by far too much of really unimportant things\n2. You are think too much and you do not even prove yourself to be right\n3. When you are feeling bad you love to amplify this feeling ?\n4. When you feel bad you speak about it normally, specially when you want \nto be heard and want to feel care and do not get into a dark room and \nsleeping for hours\nis called socialphobia and to say then no one is here no one cares if I die \nis just wrong, you are alone in your dark room, it is pretty normal that no \none will be there. \n5. When you feel bad you do expect someone cares, but most people do care,\nthey just do not know or want to respect your place of wanna be alone in \nthe dark, if you need help and want care you just ask for it and not being \nalone and think about yearning and wishes and would be\u00b4s and bad things and \nsomething weird you are making up and did not prove to be right or wrong.\n6. When you are talking it sounds like you love the melancholic mood and \npsychological personal pain ?\n7. This is your decision but I would stop also being spiritual minded when \nyou are, some people helps to be spiritual but there are a few they are \nonly bad-spiritual minded, when you see yourself there, stop being \nspiritual, thinking and living more scientific.\n8. People who wanna die do not make this public, they just disappear.\n9. You do not get positive attention by a suicide or trying to commit \nsuicide\nand when you are dead there is nothing left for attention,\nyou get positive attention by reaching goals in life or to be there for \nother people not contrary what is death speaking for all the way.\n10. You need to train your brain for positive things, because all you are \ndoing in life is to learn and to save everything, but some people do save \nnegative things as positive that is why they are always in pain and do \ncause pain. When you teach your mind with more positive things also your \nmood and relationships will change to a much more better Life for yourself \nand people who do care and love you.\n11. I think also for your dad it was not the best day of his life, he was \nvery happy you were alive, but no one would call the best day in his life \nwhen his cute, pretty, young daughter what you are, did had a suicide \nattempt, such a day is horror and not a bright day.\n12. And in the end you are saying that you were so happy that so many \npeople did care and in your depression you did thought no one would care if \nyou die without proving yourself to be right or wrong, you are lucky and \neveryone knows you, that you did not die, even not by suicide attempt \naccident what is great in the end as long as you will never try it again.\n13. Enjoy Life and when you got a bad time ask people you love to get do \nsomething no matter what to get more positive minded also when in \ndepression you do not want and you think will not help and trainee your \nmind to be more positive like hearing to positive music \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmXszn20_xw\nor reading positive things about people did achieve very great things in \ntheir life,\ndo work and create things by joy and talent/passion whatever this is,\nkeep being in relationship to other people, do not isolate yourself when \nyou got a hard time.\n14. Be thankful for hard times and take the challenge and start moving to \nget up again. \nLife would be so boring without up and downs you would not learn and live \nso intensive without joy and pain.\nAnd to be stun and isolated by pain and conflicts is not to respect what \nyou can learn and not to respect Life with also the very positive things \nwithin.\n15. Suicide attempts and suicides are very painful as you can read in \ncomments here a lot of people are upset, shocked or angry about it and they \neven do not know you, they are mostly speaking out of fear and pain by what \nyou did trying to do also when this free up to you, but unnecessary painful \nand not wise at all.\n\nSo pretty young lady, I wish you all the best and enjoy Life as much as you \ncan and hope you did read my by far too long comment repeating a lot again \nand again and get something positive by all these words and may learn from \nthat, to see yourself more important in this world by being there, instead \nof being not there and take all the challenges Life will offer you,\nwith the head up high and a smile.\ufeff"], "Paige Plays": ["\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude2d\ufeff"], "Kaitlin Prentice": ["You're so pretty!!\ufeff"], "AZ Weekly": ["I dig your style:)\ufeff"], "Evil": ["I watched the whole video ^\u2022^\ufeff"], "anna-miruna modjeschi": ["i got through the whole video , not without tearing up tho . you are such a \nbeautiful strong girl...\ufeff"], "Irene Rivera": ["Your so cute\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc95\ufeff"], "\u9759\u4f73\u5343\u5948\u7f8e": ["You're so pretty, Everyone has different issues whether it ranges from \ninsults, mental illness, etc. I suffer severe depression and I have \nattempted suicide more than twice.

All I will say is that time indeed cures all, \nincluding my pierced lung from my 2nd suicide attempt.

If you \nhave a therapist he/she should know this and should be attempting to break \nthe routine of your life; and have you develop your social skills so that \nyou can forge relationships with more people and thus expand your horizons. \nYou can draw on the wisdom of others to guide you in your own problems. It \nis NOT easy however. Nothing is, not even suicide.\n\nYou also need to desensitize yourself to the horrors and stresses of the \nworld. By your demeanor you seems like a very shy and unassertive kid that \neveryone probably ignores except maybe for some dorks who might only be \nattracted to you because you are both cute and vulnerable. Trust only those \nthat treat you like human being, do not waste your time with ego-boosters \nwho flatter you with empty BS. This will tend to aggravate you in the long \nrun. Take the advice of those who have experience in what they say.\n\nThe most important thing I can possibly share about my own suicide attempts \nis that, at that moment when you feel it is your absolute last second of \nlife, you realize that life is only worth living when you have nothing to \nlose.\ufeff"], "Itsmemarly": ["O my gash you are so beautifull \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ufeff"], "Haylie Liston": ["this is the first video I have every watched and not the last\ufeff"], "Leo Robin": ["I like ur stile\ufeff"], "Fleur Hippolite": ["I've watched it all and you are so brave.

I \nsee psychologists and doctors and take antidepressant medications. I was \ndiagnosed at 14 with mild depression and anxiety and had small doses of \nmedication prescribed to me to take every day. Over the years it got \nprogressively worse. For me, school was my outlet. I attended two different \nhigh schools, the first was an old school with pretty nasty kids, constant \nbullying, etc. I changed schools after a couple years and finally got out \nof there. I went to a nearby high school that was very modern, new, \nwell-known for going above and beyond expectations for academic excellence \nand the arts. I was still depressed and anxious, but that school was my \noutlet. I made friends, got good grades and after I graduated I got \naccepted into nursing and midwifery at university. When I was in my senior \nyear of high school my mum put me on the street and I was homeless for six \nmonths. She smashed my laptop and told me I was worthless, I remember \nstaying in the school library until early evening studying my arse off, and \nas if it were a miracle I did graduate like I said, and even got some A's \non my report card. When I started university I felt sluggish, during \neverything that happened last year (my senior year of high school) I was \ntotally broken. The friends I thought I had all told me to go to a shelter \nand offered no sympathy when I was homeless. I lost so much. I'm proud to \nsay I never got into drugs other than what my doctor was giving me for \ntreatment and I never got seriously into alcohol either (the drinking age \nin Australia where I am is 18 and I was 18 in my senior year). I struggled \nmy first semester of university, but passed, just grazed by. I have always \nwanted to be a midwife, it's my goal. There's a lot of support at uni, so I \ndecided to take a 12 month break and will go back to my degree in July \n2016. I'm no longer homeless, and luckily in Australia I get free \nhealthcare. I was in hospital shortly after I graduated and I had been \ncouch surfing place to place. My dad was the only one there when I was in \nhospital. I was able to go home after a few days and attended my high \nschool graduation a couple weeks later and soon found out I got accepted \ninto uni. Right now I'm doing a course a few days a week at TAFE (it's an \nAustralian thing that stands for Technical and Further Education/training). \nI'm sticking with my nursing and midwifery, doing work placement at a \nhospital right now and will return to uni when that time comes. I've wanted \nto be a health care worker since I was four, and despite every thing I'm \ndoing it. Suicidal thoughts still come to me regularly, but I haven't self \nharmed in almost 12 months. I'm still getting treatment, but I'm also still \ngoing to school and career minded. One of my longest and closest friends \nhas helped me through. My friend that I'm leaving nameless of course, tried \nto commit suicide two years ago, hasn't tried again. They lost a loved one \nand did it out of depression and grief. I lost my Aunt in June this year \nand I'm still grieving, but I'm getting help. I'm trying to get my license \nand focus on a job and classes so I can head back to uni in a year. \n\nThank you for sharing your story, love and light xx\ufeff"], "Nika Fuchkan": ["You inspire me so much..Thank you, you are amazeballs \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\ufeff"], "Kalie Strain": ["You are so amazing.

The Bible gives \na fundamental reason why many are in such a state of despair. It explains \nthat we live in \u201ccritical times hard to deal with.\u201d People feel the \npressures of life with great intensity. (2 Timothy 3:1; Ecclesiastes 7:7) \nWhen a person is overwhelmed by life\u2019s anxieties, he may \ncontemplate suicide as a means to escape pain. What can you do if you have \nhad such thoughts?You Are Not Alone!Even though your situation may seem \ndesperate, remember that you are not alone and that sadly \nnearly everyone is coping with some type of problem today. The Bible \nstates: \u201cAll creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain \ntogether.\u201d (Romans 8:22) While in the short term it may seem that your \nproblem will never be resolved, things often do improve with the passing of \ntime. In the meantime, what can help?Share your feelings with a mature, \ntrusted friend. The Bible says: \u201cA true companion is loving all the time, \nand is a brother that is born for when there is distress.\u201d (Proverbs 17:17) \nThe righteous man Job, described in the Bible, opened up to others during \nhis period of turmoil. When he felt what he referred to as \u201ca loathing \ntoward my life,\u201d he stated: \u201cI will give vent to my concern about myself. I \nwill speak in the bitterness of my soul!\u201d (Job 10:1) Confiding in others \ncan diminish the intensity of your emotions, and it may give you a fresh \nperspective on the problems you face.*Pour out your heart to God in \nprayer. Some have the idea that prayer is just a psychological crutch, but \nthe Bible says otherwise. Psalm 65:2 calls Jehovah God the \u201cHearer of \nprayer,\u201d and 1 Peter 5:7 says: \u201cHe cares for you.\u201d The Bible repeatedly \nstresses the importance of relying on God. For example:\u201cTrust in Jehovah \nwith all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all \nyour ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths \nstraight.\u201d\u2014PROVERBS 3:5, 6.\u201cThe desire of those fearing [Jehovah] he will \nperform, and their cry for help he will hear, and he will save them.\u201d\u2014PSALM \n145:19.\u201cThis is the confidence that we have toward him, that, no matter \nwhat it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.\u201d\u20141 JOHN 5:14.\u201cJehovah \nis far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he \nhears.\u201d\u2014PROVERBS 15:29.If you tell God the difficulties you face, he will \nprovide help. For good reason, the Bible encourages you to \u201ctrust in him at \nall times . . .

I remember the day we found out (my brothers and I) that \nmy parents were divorcing, everyone, including my mother started bawling \ncrying, and i wanted to do the same but something inside forbade me from \ncrying and I was convinced that I had to be \"strong\" for them. My dad moved \nout when I was still in elementary school. During that time i slept maybe \nan hour a night because i would just walk back and forth, feeling obligated \nto protect my mother and younger brothers and during that time i just felt \nso alone and would think the most negative thoughts, about myself and my \nappearance, what i could have done to cause this situation and a horrible \nincident that happened with my baby sitter when i was 3. Anyway, that \ncarried on and as i got older i started feeling worse and worse about \nmyself and my peers didn't help at all. Constantly ridiculed in front of \nand behind my back. I tried to self medicated with drugs and alcohol and \ndeveloped an eating disorder. After a while i didn't want to live at all. I \nspent all of my time in my room in complete darkness. I shut off my phone \nand every form of social media and just dwelled on how much I felt like \neveryone hated me and how useless i was to everyone and how disgusting i \nwas and how much of a shame i was etc. I contemplated and tried to go \nthrough with suicide several times but couldn't bring myself to FULLY go \nthrough with it. I would always panic and feel worse thinking about how my \nbrothers would feel. Anyway, I have sought out the proper help and have \nsurrounded myself with an amazing support group including my family and \nfriends. I still have spells were i feel incredibly guilty and worthless \nbecause of the worry and grief that i have caused the people that truly \ncare about me. But I'm working on it and trying my best every day to do \neverything i can to take care of myself. I'm sorry about the long message I \njust wanted to share WHY your story touched me so much and wanted to give \nmy whole hearted thanks for sharing your own story because it made me and \ni'm sure many others feel like we're not alone in how we feel.
