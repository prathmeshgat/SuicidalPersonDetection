But then the next day was the worst day ever. \nAfter that day of school my mom was pissed at me because she got a call. \nWhen we got home, CPS was there to talk to my brothers and sisters. They \nlied and so did I because I was terrified of what my step-father would do. \nHe ended up not having to go to court and all the charges against him were \ngone.

I \nspent all my spare time at home in my room. I went to a very small school, \na total of about 100-150 in grades 9-12, and if you weren't friends with \none person most people didn't like you. I was the quiet girl that sat there \nwhile the other girls and most of the guys ridiculed me. I attempted to \ncommit suicide a fair few times but never really got the courage to do it, \nbut the more I didn't do it I would self-harm. Things got better my junior \nyear, we had gotten a new student and she actually talked to me. She soon \nbecame my best friend. We did everything together despite all of our \ndifferences. Others didn't understand our relationship, but most accepted \nit. Everyone liked her, so I started to get accepted with most people. By \nthe time I graduated I got along with everyone in my class besides one, I \nonly had a total of seven people in my class. About a year later I got with \nmy boyfriend and after a year of being together I got pregnant. My best \nfriend and I had gotten into a fight, and she didn't want to be my friend \nanymore. Losing my best friend on top of telling my family, which are \nChristians and look down on sex before marriage, that I was pregnant was \nkilling me. I was terrified and I didn't know what to do. I hadn't felt \nthis way since I was in high school and I hadn't self-harmed since I \npromised my best friend I wouldn't. I didn't have her anymore and I felt \nshe wouldn't care anymore, but I didn't do it. I drove to my moms house and \nI told her. She obviously wasn't excited about it at first but, she and the \nrest of my family slowly accepted it and it made me so happy. I was going \nto have a baby and I was engaged to someone that I was completely in love \nwith. I was now 4 months pregnant and I went to work, I looked at the \nschedule and noticed I wasn't scheduled anymore. I went and talked to my \nboss and she told me to look for another job because they just don't need \nme anymore. I was devastated, I needed a job because my fiance didn't have \nthat great of a job and there was no way we were going to make it. He told \nme it was going to be okay and I didn't have to work. Made me feel a bit \nbetter so I was okay. April 1, 2015 at 12:45 PM I had a beautiful daughter \nnamed Jocelynn Paige. Everything was great and I even got a call, asking me \nto come in for an interview when she was six months old. Everything was \ngreat. It was almost mine and my fiances 2 year anniversary, and I was \ngetting ready the night before to go to work. He called me and told me he \nwanted to break up with me. We've been fighting but he was tired of \nfighting and he didn't want to be with me anymore. I figured he just needed \nsome space of I said okay and I knew we would work it out. It was Halloween \nweekend and he went to a party, I stayed home with our daughter, and I woke \nup the next morning to my aunt sending me pictures of his Facebook. He had \ncheated on me, it wasn't the first time either, but it was the last time. I \npacked all of mine and Jocelynn's things and we left. I know that I wrote a \nlot and I basically told everyone my life story, but the point I'm trying \nto make is, its been about three months since my heart was broken, and my \nengagement crumbled in front of my face.
