You gotta find and make your own support \nmechanism at home, believe me, there are people who care and who will \nlisten who live probably like right around the corner or 5 blocks away. \nMake your own happy place. If you ever need anyone to talk to, you have \nhundreds of people who would be willing to talk to you, including me (even \nif I live in a shitty town all the way here in Cali).

I have to tell you, it took a \ngreat deal of strength to make this video.  After watching some of your \nvideos, I confirmed what a great guy you are.  To your old friends you, \ncorrectly put them out of your life - it is truly their loss.  Your friends \nin LA make a real difference in how you talk, kid around - you are happy.  \nOhio, I guess is where you live, but you have a home in LA.  I'm an older \nguy that knows what you mean and I understand those feelings at your age.  \nIt made me sad - but after I listened more - I think you know your \nhappiness will be about you and you'll be free to live where you find that \nhappiness.  It happened for me, long ago - but the sad parts - I said \ngood-bye to and started on a life which suited me and made me happy.  \nYou'll have that too.   My biggest reason for writing this, is to say - it \nreally does get BETTER.  Count on it !  I understand exactly what you're \nsaying & feeling.  I was there once.  By your attitude, things seems to \nhave gotten better - more positive.  All the bad stuff will be a distant \nmemory and you'll make your life to make you happy.  Changing schools \nsounds like a positive move.  I'll leave you with this;  If you truly feel \nbetter about things when you talk to someone - keep doing it.  A counselor, \ntherapist does make a difference mainly because they are a support \"group\" \nfor YOU !  Never keep it bottled up.  I came out a long time ago - at a \ntime when it was more difficult to do it without a cost.  My parents were \nwonderful about it and some of my friends I never heard from again - but \nyou make new friends.  The thing about LA is that it is a very accepting \nplace; West LA, WEHO, Silverlake etc  (I live in Nevada, but was born in \nSouthern CA.  I worked in Downtown LA, Hollywood, Beverly Hills etc).  Just \nremember that even in LA, you'll run into people as you have in Ohio.  Just \nnot as many.  But in LA and CA in general, you'll find that your happiness \nwill ever increase and you can call it home if that's what you want.  I \nagree you need a larger change - a new school was a good change.  You will \nfind Kyle, that there are people - both straight and gay who care about \nyou.  You have a right to be happy, stay on that road and you'll find \nhappiness can become an everyday thing.

In the third grade my mother started to go out to bars \nto drink often after my grandpa died. him being her only parent left. she \nwas fine at first but it gradually got worse and worse.... and worse..... \nEventually leaving to go to a bar after work and not coming home until the \nvery next day. My big brother was In the sixth grade and I thought \neverything was fine. until the day he started to hit me. one day it went \ntoo far. I tried to tell my mom but she believed him over me. when my \nbrother went into seventh grade the next year he got bullied. I wasn't even \naware. the beatings continued. but this time it was different.... he \nstarted to call me names and basically bully me. he said it had been my \nfault our parents had gotten a divorce when I was three. He called me \nworthless, fat, etc. No names a big brother should ever call his sister. \neventually my mom got a boyfriend. My brother did not like this and he \neventually moved to my dads. leaving me all alone. in fifth grade I only \nhad one friend. everyone else used me and lied to me. If it weren't for her \nI would probably be dead right now. over summer break I started to get \nreally depressed and lonely. it got to the point I literally thought I was \nuseless. I started to listen to rock music because it drew me in. it was \nsomething I could rely on. Music was my rock. But music could not save me \nfrom myself. I started to self harm. it wasn't that bad though. it wasn't \ndeep just enough to draw blood. I have the night my mom caught me etched \ninto my brain I will never forget the words that left her mouth. 'weird.' \nwas what she said. she took my pocket knife and left me in my room to cry \nmyself to sleep. from the start of the sixth grade my problems just got \nworse. I was getting bullied 'emo bitch' and 'Gothic freak' are the two I \nremember most. The day I cried was the worst. I was told my best friend was \nmoving to California. But I lived in Florida. I would never see her again. \nit killed me. before she moved I remember growing distant. I was so \ndepressed I didn't have time for anything. She was my everything. She \nlifted me up when no one else could. I eventually moved to my dads. I met \ntwo boys. I loved it but for some reason I felt I had to move to my moms \nbecause she basically told me that she missed me and things would be \ndifferent. well, the summer before seventh grade my brother told me 'so why \ndid you tell him?\" I was so confused. tell him what? who was him? well, him \nwas my best friend. I told him a secret of mine that I had only recently \ntold my parents. but he asked my brother if it was true. (this was one of \nthe guys I'd met when I lived with my dad.) and he of course said it wasn't \nso the boy told my boyfriend (the other guy I'd met while living with dad) \nmy secret. my brother now knew that I'd told people what he'd done to me at \njust age 8. The boy I was dating asked me if it was true. so I told him \nthat it was (that being the truth.) he believed me. However after that day \nwith him knowing this I had felt so ashamed I had gone to the lengths of \nnot even talking to him. He eventually broke up with me. it honestly broke \nmy heart. I felt empty. I ended up going to a place called MHRC. mental \nhealth rehabilitation center. its for people who are either crazy or are \nsuicidal. and I was suicidal. I had made cuts down my stomach, arms, legs, \nand chest. though I had cut many times before, this was much worse than \never before. the only time I'd cut near this bad was the middle of sixth \ngrade when I had cut from my hand down to my elbow. so yes, I went to a \nmental hospital for three days. I came home and it was only worse. they \nchanged my medication and gave me the highest dosage. I was still very \nsuicidal. all they told me to do when I felt like cutting was to take a \nrubber band and pop myself as hard as o could with it. well, that didn't \nwork. I needed to see blood and get way more pain than that. I finally was \ntold by my mom and her new husband that I needed to stop being 'emo' and \nthat that that was what has been causing my depression. well, I fought \nback. I tried so hard. I ended up sobbing and pleading 'just let me call my \ndad' but no. they broke my radio. they took my door off the henges and took \nalmost everything I owned. but it didn't matter. they broke my radio. my \nonly release besides self harm. I was never really the same since that day. \nmy light was taken. the flame that once burned so bright was gone. I \neventually moved to my dad the summer before eighth grade. after a fight \nwith my mom. she had told me to suck it up when the topic of bullying was \nbrought up. but I'd even been told to kill myself. I guess some people just \naren't as strong as others. but I won't ever let anyone take my fire ever \nagain. I just got it back. and I've been trying to stop self harming. I've \nbeen clean for a month now. the my digital escape videos really help. also \nmusic and writing as well. I just wanted to say thanks for making me smile \nand laugh when no one else can.

There \nare two states I can't stand to be in because it just reminds me of things \nthat I've tried so hard to forget. New York, my home state is the first \none. My 'dad' lives there, and that's where I was born. I hate it there \nmostly because it reminds me of my 'dad'. When my 'dad' found out that my \nmother was pregnant with me, he was furious and told her to get an \nabortion. When I was born, he hated me, and wanted nothing to do with me so \none day while he was at work my mom packed me, herself, and my brother up \nand drove us down to South Carolina, where I'm living now. The reason I \nhate being here, is because of two main reasons. My 'dad' and school. All \nmy life here in SC I have tried to create a relationship with that man, \nonly for him to ignore and deny me every single time. But one day, when I \nwas at my grandma's house, he decided to show up to visit me only to get \nmad when I wasn't there. For years he hasn't contacted me. In my final \nattempt, I asked him to come to my 9th birthday party and alone, so we \ncould talk and (hopefully) form a relationship. Instead, he came with his \ngirlfriend and barley talked to me. Fed up, I gave up and continued on with \nmy life. When I was 10 and when school got actually serious, I was bullied \na lot for my looks. I was called fat, disgusting, ugly, and other foul \nwords. I had a friend that was being bullied herself and when witnessing \nit, I walked up to them and stuck up for her, only for her to turn on me \nand start ganging up on me. I've been beaten up twice here, one by a group \nof boys and the other by a group of girls. I've been sexually harassed by a \nstudent in school, my best friend that I've known since kindergarten, has \nignored me and belittled me,  and many other experiences that caused me to \ngo into online schooling. When I was also ten, my 'dad' decided to file a \ncase for visitation, right when I got over him and that was the start of my \ndepression. I didn't want to go, and no matter how many times I pleaded for \nhim not to go on with it he did and I was forced to leave to visit him \nevery other week and was almost forced to go to New York with him for the \nwhole summer. Under a lot of pressure, I began self-harm at twelve. I \nstopped when I was thirteen because I realized I was causing more pain for \nthose around me then relieving myself of it. I've thought about committing \nsuicide but I'm too cowardly to actually go through with it. To be blunt, \nyou and MDE saved me. You've made me laugh at times when I didn't think it \nwas possible and for that, I thank you. I hate that you feel this way and \nif there was any way I could help you *not* feel that way, I would do it. \nI'm fourteen, but I've got a job dog/cat/babysitting and hopefully, I'll \nmake enough to help fund you so you can move to L.A.

I know how you feel Ohio sucks. I know \nbecause I live there too. Cleveland is the worst. I've been bullied since I \nwas in 3rd grade. I was called fat. Ugly. And a lot more. And when I \nstarted cutting myself in 6th grade it got worst. For 7th I transfered \nschool. That was the first time I've ever transfered school. I made one \nfriend the first day of school. I was really happy. But the other days were \nhorrible. In like February 2014 I was diagnosed with depression. I used \nalways sit by myself and cry. Because knowing that I don't have the support \nI want and need hurt. And still does. People found out my mom was is a \nlesbian and started judging me because I'm bi. In 8th the bullying stopped \nbut again but started. I tried killing myself. People thought I was crazy. \nBut when I tried I was all alone at home. Like always. My dad is always \nworking and my mom hasn't been there for a long time. My mom left me when I \nwas 3 and came back in my life when I was 6. Then she left me when I was 8 \nand came back when I was 11. And my mom and dad never want me in their \nhouse. They always find a way to either get me out the house or to make not \n\"get in the way\" like they say it. It hurts knowing neither my mother nor \nfather wants me. But the March 2015 came. I got suspended for getting in a \nfight with a bully and I accidentally hit a teacher. My mom's girlfriend \ntook my phone. She threatened to bust my lip. And of coarse my mom did \nnothing like always. My mom's ex girlfriend would always beat me. My room \nwas in a attic with no heat nor air conditioning. My mom did nothing. Her \nex girlfriend would lock me up there and ground me for no reason. But I \ncan't do nothing about it because where am I going to go. To a adoption \ncenter. I only have a couple years left until I'm 18 and no body would want \nto adopt me. And now my brother is in jail for 2 years for an accident that \nwasn't his fault. And that friend I got on the first day of 7 the grade. \nShe ripped my heart out. She told me to loose some weight and go cut \nmyself... So that's my life story.
