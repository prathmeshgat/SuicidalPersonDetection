I hate \nseeing people who seem so wonderful in this much pain because I get it, \nI've been through things like this; attempted suicide a few times and no \none deserves to go through this. You will get through this though ;please \ndon't let this pain stop you from one day doing great things or \naccomplishing future goals.\ufeff"], "Mitchell Keet": ["Just like the others already said, it's very brave to share this story like \nthis! You've been struggling with this for so long now. And I understand if \nit al feels so hopeless that despite all the help and support you've \nalready recieved, you still feel like this. It is hard to get out of a \nstate of mind like this. But like I said before in a comment on one of your \nearlier video's: it is an accomplishment that you're still here! Even if it \ndoesn't feel like it. A little while ago you talked about how it upset you \nthat you can't start testosterone in the near future. I know it sucks, I've \nbeen waiting for 2,5 years now to start testosteron. And I'm still waiting. \nBut I'm not gonna give up now. Because that way all the energie I've \nalready spend on it, would have been a waste of time. A lot of trans people \nwho struggle with mental stuff start to feel better when their transition \nis going somewhere. I'm sure this wil happen for you too, because the \nthought of starting testosterone soon.. already made you feel better and \ngave you hope, right? It just sucks that it didn't happen yet. But it will \nhappen one day. Keep fighting for it! If you manage to become stable, the \nchance that it will happen soon will get bigger. I understand that you \ncan't change this overnight... it takes time. And even if you've started \ntestosterone you still might struggle with this. Testosterone doens't cure \neverything, like everyone is saying. But I believe that it will make you \nfeel a lot better, make you even stronger and help you cope with the hard \nthings. It will help if you feel more comfortable in your own skin. I \nreally hope you keep fighting, so that the world won't lose such a good guy \nlike you! I also hope this was meaningful for you in some way. And I wish \nyou all the strength you need! I really hope to see you happy in your \nvideo's one day :)\ufeff"]}}
