I think it's natural for everyone to want to be accepted and loved. \nAt the same time, you need people that love you for who you are.\n\nSadly, I know a lot of people who turn to relationships in search of \nhappiness. They think that having someone that loves them will make \neverything better. Unfortunately that's not how it works. If you have \nproblems within, those problems are still going to be around no matter who \nyou're with. Being in a relationship isn't going to solve all of your \nproblems. You have to be happy with yourself by yourself, before you can be \nhappy with someone else. Focus on you first and then everything else will \nfall into place.\n\nDon't let people who do so little for you control so much of your life. I \nknow that may sound easier said than done, but it's so important that you \nknow what you're worth. If someone is a bad influence or they're getting in \nthe way of you becoming the person that you want to be, you need to cut \nthem out of your life unapologetically. Those people are not your friends. \nThose people are holding you back. They don't deserve you.\n\nAs soon as you start thinking like that, instead of it being such a big \nlose that you're no longer with them, you'll realize that it's really their \nloss.

Here we go...\n\nBack a few years ago my friend and I were at different schools, different \nfriends, but we still remained close. But one of her new friends, let's \ncall her Bailey, had developed a great friendship. Well, one day another \none of her friends, let's call her Jenna, found out something really \npersonal about Bailey. Apparently she was, not raped, but abused sexually \nand only five people knew about. Well, Jenna was very popular, so one day \nduring acting class, Jenna got up on stage and told a story similar story \nto that of Bailey's. The story grew over the next few weeks. When word got \nback to Bailey, she took it negatively, let's put it that way. She started \ninflicting harm on herself, etc.. So one day, she (I'm not sure how she \ncommitted suicide, I don't want to know, that's for my friend, let's call \nher Anne, to know) committed suicide. Anne became a mess.
