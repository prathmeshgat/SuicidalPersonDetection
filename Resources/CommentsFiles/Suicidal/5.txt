It's definitely hard to overcome stuff like that but I would \ntry coming up with a mantra such as \"I don't need to be in control all the \ntime, I can choose when I want to be\" and every time you feel yourself \nfreaking out, teach yourself to say it. \n\nAnother tip would be to start a diary (but kind of a factual one which you \nwill like because it's detailed.) Just make a note of the date and time, \nsituation you're in, level of anxiety or worry you have, from 1-5 (5 being \nthe highest level of freak out that you personally have), all the negative \nthoughts and feelings you have and THEN when you're in the situation you \nwant to try and make a positive/reassuring statement.. for example if \nyou're thinking \"What if I push all my friends away?\" Say to yourself \"If \nthey were real friends they wouldn't leave\". If you are able to do this in \nthe situation it goes in your diary and then state your level of anxiety \nAFTER you have made the positive statement and what happened after this. \nThis step is a lot of effort but it helps because you don't have to be \nworrying about it yourself as the data is all in front of you and it is so \neffective in teaching you to rewire your brain as you are having to remind \nyourself to make a positive statement so that you can note it down in the \ndiary, PLUS it helps to identify your triggers. \n\nBut finally it helps to surround yourself with people who can support \nyou... Obviously Youtube will help with this but in your everyday life as \nwell. Just envision what you want your life to be like - if you can show \nyourself that all this worry and sadness doesn't help you then you will \nfind it easier to work towards getting better. \n\nI know this is long (lol) and probably not perfect because I'm about to \nleave for school so I rushed to type it but I just want you or anyone else \non this comment thread to know that it is POSSIBLE to get better, it's not \neasy but it is more than possible. \n\nLove and best wishes :) xxx\ufeff"], "Ashley Harris": ["Meditate.
