hey what's up you guys so today I want to talk about something a little more
serious
so if you're not into that click off if you are into that
stay here cry with me listen to inspirational Sarah McLachlan music we
can all lay in each others arms and whisper sweet nothings of one up
um so today I want to talk about cutting not funny but the way I said that was
fine
ok so in one of my last videos the halloween video
there was a joke where the girl was carving harry styles into her arm and
and everybody went crazy because it going from the cutting on and I'm not
because basically if I was she be crying
cutting where she was excited and she was carving giving yourself a homemade
fucking tact who carries thousand are and I've done that joke before i did it
with one of my lady gaga spoofs were a gay guy carpenter got his arm
I've done a million times nobody ever got mad but people got mad
a couple weeks ago when i close to that so I want to talk more about it because
I don't want you guys to think I'm some insensitive jerk
I deal with things in a way that a lot of people don't understand
I am somebody that was that
it's a random number of telling me hey girl hey everybody it's my mom
yeah she's a girl hey I'm explain so much so that her mom okay cut it so I
deal with things with comedy
I as some of you guys might know and some of you don't I dealt with
depression a lot these last four years
I well before i started youtube I lost obviously you guys are in a couple
hundred pounds and then I was dealing with that and losing that much weight
that fast fucks with your head
enormously and I was a mess and I was depressed and I was anxious and i also
had
well okay i was going to talk about this but I'm going to talk about it fuck it
i'm gonna talk about everything today
I was borderline suicidal because i had 15 pounds of extra skin on the body and
it was just hanging and I was covering it up and I was wearing man girdles and
I was
that's when I started making YouTube videos because I was trying to you know
focus my attention on something else and then there would be comments that are
saying you know you look fat you look fabulous fat because you know that's
what the internet is and it drove my depression really really really bad so
I'm eventually i saved up some money and I got the surgery to get the skin taking
off and you guys probably remember that if you've been watching me for a while
I don't really talk about with the surgery was it was a skin removal
surgery they took a 15 pound skin and they also have to fix up a bunch of
things inside of my body because losing weight that fast
fucking out so that happened that's why I have scars there so that happened
also wow I can't believe it
i'm talking about a list well why not
let's get wasted and discuss on so then my grandma died and i got to really bad
depression but I didn't have time that Pierce deal because this is going to
sound crazy but youtube to me has been a way to get away from my problems but it
also is keeping me from dealing with my problems
so like every time I'm depressed instead of dealing with it
I make a video every time I should probably go to church or pray or cry or
one of those things i make a video and I'm trying to not do that lately that's
why I might have missed a couple videos in the last year because i'm missing
video that means I'm taking some me time and I'm trying to deal with my fucking
shit
so yeah I may not be a cutter
oh yeah i mean i have tried to kill myself and yeah I may not
you know look like a depressed person but I have delicate for a long time so
when people were getting mad at me saying oh god you don't care about is
you don't care about depression you don't care about cutting
it's like well no I do obviously I deal with the first hand
but the way I deal with it is by making jokes about it
I make jokes about eating disorders I make jokes about white people black
people fat people skinny people to press people not depressed people make jokes
about everybody because that's kind of
if you know if you can't laugh at yourself and what the fuck is the point
of living
that's the way I look at it but I am sorry if I heard some of you guys his
feelings because in all honesty when I made it I didn't even think about it I
was like nobody's gonna get mad at this it's funny
so when people got mad I was like nooooo so on
so that's that and then you know as far as you guys asked me had like sometimes
you guys say oh how should i deal with my depression
you know my old answer used to be all find something creative and just start
doing that but there has to be something else because you know sometimes if you
ignore it it gets worse
like it did for me so in all honesty you gotta take some time for yourself and
you gotta really think about it and you really got a plan out what you're going
to do next and like for me I got depressed because i have had a lot of
ups and downs of my career and you guys haven't really seen it but in Hollywood
I've had a lot of like really close calls with getting a TV show or really
close calls with getting a movie and it always falls off and it always never
happens
and that can really fuck you up you know really fucked me up so I have been
dealing with that this last year and now I'm trying to focus my energy toward the
future I want to direct my own movie next year I want to have my own TV show
next year I want to answer to anybody I want to do my thing and that's what's
been helping me get through just sitting and being depressed focusing on the
future
so let me know in a comment or a video response even better tell me what's
going on with you are you dealing with depression
how do you deal with it what's your go-to thing do you eat - you cry
do you watch TV to watch youtube and also what you want to do about it
do you want to get rid of it because I do all right you guys
I'm gonna go my voice is going away I mean what's happening
sorry this was probably boring for some of you guys who are depressed and you're
very happy you're like this is not funny
I'm sorry but I make a funny video tomorrow i promise i love you guys
thanks for sharing thanks for loving me and I love you so much and i'm never
gonna stop making videos and even if i get really really depressed i'm not
going to go away and I know a lot of you guys really go away but i'm not i'm not
going to cry because that's embarrassing
ok let's cry
