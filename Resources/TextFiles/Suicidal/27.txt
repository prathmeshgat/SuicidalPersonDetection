it's just this fog over your mind and this exhaustion a lot of times i just
wish i could just like fall asleep and sleep all the time not even be awake
hey guys it's Lizzie so this is not going to be a fun video for me to make
but it's something that I need to talk about
today I'm talking about major depression and it's something that I've been
struggling with for most of this year there are quite a few prominent
youtubers who made videos talking about how they've had depression but it what I
don't see a lot of his people explaining what it feels like I'm going to looks
like when someone is depressed and the reason I'm making this is because i had
no idea i had depression until he got so bad i decided to make this video back in
April it was the night before my math final and one of my friends said
something along the lines of just get over it
super in validating and running out of my apartment it was like about midnight
or something and have any shoes on and Iran to this field and I laid on the
ground in the grass
I just cried and cried I was crying because I felt disconnected for myself
and that's a really strange feeling and I honestly don't know how to explain it
but until actually like I Know Who I am I know what I'm passionate about I know
my personality is but I'm not myself at all it's like I'm stuck in this body and
I've lost in this awful awful feeling once i started going to treatment going
to counseling seeing a psychiatrist going on medication
it's about two months until i saw any improvement
that's why I want to talk about symptoms what it looks like but you can recognize
this in yourself or your friends I always imagined myself making this video
and I thought that I would you know
come on camera and a
I had major depression and then I went and got help I went on medication and
then it went away I thought it would be this inspiring story of how I got
completely better but that's not what happened
I still have major depression and this past week at school was really bad i
skipped about half my classes I stopped eating again and how many energy i had
insomnia lot that's because of major depressive episode last from nine months
to a year and so even after you get on medication and get treatment and get a
bit more energy you're still fighting and if i'm not working out throughout
the week ahead like forcing myself to be on the same schedule and like get enough
sleep that it comes back so i started going to counseling we got back from
Spring Break which was the end of febuary and the reason we into
counseling was because I wasn't eating
I remember the day before I left my home in Florida and the day I got back to
California between those two days i think i had one meal and two snacks in
two days and I wasn't even hungry and I realized like I have barely eaten in two
days what's going on
I have purposely by myself food and pass try to lose weight and so I understand
what it feels like when you're insecure trying to get to certainly but this had
nothing to do with insecurities like I love my body I didn't want to change I
just wasn't eating and I wasn't hungry and I guess to explain this
the reason I wouldn't want to eat is not only because I wasn't hungry but it is
the thought of like getting out food from the fridge boiling a pot of water
getting a plate putting think that is so much effort
everything feels like so much effort once i was going to counseling and got
diagnosed with depression and I look back on the past few months and there
were all these random symptoms that i had not all connected to each other but
that we're all because of the
relying depression my depression is very physical and mental I had before going
through all this i had the impression that depression was emotionally was
crying all the time and being really negative and pessimistic and hopeless
wanted to kill yourself but for me it's very physical and mental one thing that
controls me so much is fatigue before I went on medication and like went to see
a psychiatrist I had to go and get a ton of blood test done and test you for
model because made a depression feels like not like the petite you feel is the
same in both it's so intense and it's just like the feeling like you need to
lay in bed and fall asleep only you're not tired at all i think at first I can
use the fatigue for need to sleep more and so last semester the spring semester
I there were two days a week ready to start class until 1pm and I remember I
was sleeping like until new even if i went to bed like at ten o'clock or
@midnight I would sleep for like upwards of 12 hours because i was so tired and
it would be so hard to get on the bed and like go to class so I remember even
at the time googling like fatigue like what's going on the entire when i wake
up because it was like it was very significantly went on for like two
months and of course fatigue is literally acceptable like 200 different
diseases that combined with the not eating and just general loss of passion
i am a philosophy major at my university I love school I love reading and writing
and like talking about philosophy and at the time i remember i had a conversation
with one of my closest bag that was telling him i don't like velocity
anymore it's so pointless and I was explaining all the reasons why didn't
like it and so I had this like loss of passionate all anger towards something
that previously I was really passionate about so with day in the life of me what
I had to press it was really bad back in the spring is I would be laying on my
bed all day and at the time being on my bed
it felt so state and comfortable and just like the best and i don't want to
be anywhere else i just wanted to lay in bed under my covers all day i also
remember being really bored because I spend most of my time being productive
reading writing doing school going to clubs and doing stuff and when I had to
press anything i didn't want go do anything I want to see my normal day and
sleep and a lot of times i just wish i could just like fall asleep and sleep
all the time not even be awake i am not a social media person at all but i would
just go on random website watch BuzzFeed videos just like waste time and just
stay in there all day not eat to really sad life to explain the lack of
motivation getting out of bed
putting clothes on and taking a shower eating you like that was so much effort
if i was able to do that a day and like somehow get to my studying that was like
wow like 10 out of 10 like good dog with a type thing a lot of it is physical if
you're physically fatigued but there's also this mental block that keeps you
from doing things and so thinking of doing the dishes or clean my room or
vacuuming when anymore was lying still hard and well i started doing was
skipping all my classes I would just not go to class something else that was
really intense with my depression is this mental like slowed down like
everything slowed down it's almost like there's a fog around you and it's like
the world is moving like a normal pace you're just kind of like looking one of
my classes
when I had freshman we will be watching a movie and it was like so much to
process we finish the documentary and then you put part to the documentary
that was like oh my gosh this is so painful that he's not giving us a break
like processing it hurt so much because it's like your brain is not processing
at the normal pace and they've done brain scans of people with depression
and without people with depression issues your brain activity is majorly
slow down
this creates an inability to concentrate and so in classes even like a church
during sermons I just cannot process it it's just like look your brain is just
not functioning very well and even reading it would make me feel physically
dizzy but I did not read my Bible for like two months because it was like if i
try to sit down and read anything that was like somewhat intellectual it was
just like I felt so dizzy not only mentally but physically I remember even
at church and I have my skip church a lot during this time because like I'm
going to wake up but one time at church we were praying and I have a eyes-closed
I had to open them because I felt so dizzy
it almost feels like a mental fog and so we're calling words is really hard like
sometimes I'll make a joke and I can't think of like the pipeline through don't
like you can't think of the word and so for schoolwork this is just awful
because you cannot write and you're trying to write an essay and you're
bringing just cannot think of the words and even has whole conversation like
when I was hanging out with my friends so responding to people it just it's so
hard
I always thought the Depression had to be caused by some sort of event going on
and for me nothin cause it I was so optimistic and happy about my life if
you'd asked me in February to describe how my life is going right now and how
would I think about my future I feel like perfectly everything is the
following things exactly how I wanted to be up so looking forward to the future
i'm so happy with all my friends in my life like I was so optimistic and even
when I had depression like it wasn't like I had this negative mindset that
was causing it was just the comedy should have a ton of different stressors
all coming together at the same time and a time I I was like why this is
happening I had no idea what was happening but looking back there were a
lot of things that I've done like put together a ton of different things that
were emotionally mentally work situations a lot of things that were
stressing me out something else another question I have didn't make sense to me
was why am i getting depression now because junior year of college
I'm getting a decent amount of sleep and when I was really sleep-deprived back in
high school like the hotel was a teenager
it would be so normal for me to like live off three hours of sleep and then
on the weekends crash and sleep for 15 hours and i was so normal and I was like
why don't look at the present then why not only how understand i feel like i've
heard so much about people who are teens with depression and if it were more
likely to hear about that because it's so shocking for a child to have
depression but most mental disorders come out in your early twenties
one thing I don't talk about is eating and sleep so for some people they
overeat for me I under eight so I was like so everyone solve and i actually
lost a lot of weight i probably lost like five or ten pounds and I'm getting
a little garlic because when you go on crash diets it doesn't work and it
wasn't a diet for me it was like a mental thing not giving me an appetite
but it was really really a healthy and for sleep
most people have insomnia types of dumb i had a mixture of both but usually it
was it's called hypersomnia with your meeting to sleep so much and it's not
only this like physical fatigue but it's like you literally feel like you need to
sleep so much more and so that's why it's so hard to get out of bed in the
morning because your brain is telling you to sleep more and then also i will
get insomnia sometimes to wear like I could not fall asleep I don't have
insomnia I'm coming back to school with past few weeks has been really awful a
lot of people who have depression who are girls tend to cry more guys to get
more angry
my personality is more like assertive and less emotional more logical and so
the way my personality espresso-based profession is more anger and irritation
at the crime
I would actually say that I cried less when I had depression then when I didn't
have depression
the way my console explained it is that it's kind of like this like cycle where
your depression is making your braids slow down and then your oversleeping
you're not exercising as much as you feel tired you're not eating and so
you're getting you're giving yourself less and less and less energy and then
because you have less energy you continually like wanna lay in bed all
day and it keeps getting worse and worse and worse and that's why I went on
medication because I consider myself a generally strong person like if I'm
dealing with something in my life that's really hurting me
I didn't still continue my life help out other people give them an emotional
support but with this
it was just something I was not strong enough to fight against I had the whole
the brick metaphor there's a brick wall preventing me from doing anything and
the medications like a ladder so it helps you get over the quality doesn't
mean like oh like quick-fix like I take a pill every morning and I'm totally
fine getting on medication that works for you
that takes a long time it takes about three weeks with the medication to kick
in so I went on this medication called a few trip for three weeks no effect and
then I try a second medication prozac which luckily ended up working and then
after three weeks
it kicked in and it was almost instant when it kicked in to where I still
remember the weekend when this finally kicked in and it was so much fun because
I finally felt like myself for the first time in months and I was laughing and
none of it was fake and it was just like the best but even though I'm on
medication i'm still in the nine months to a year major depressive episode and
so I still have to be so careful about getting enough sleep exercising eating
and the school going on right now I'm stressed to help behind all the reading
and stuff and so it's coming back and it's something
that I continually have to fight against some other stuff you can do besides
medication or ammunition medication exercising is the best thing you can do
and so exercise every day and you need to do cardio so do something that like
brings your heart beat up to that like beating really fast type ping you
exercise and you don't see an immediate result it will take a few days for the
chemicals to process so if you do a cardio workout and your heartbeat is up
and you feel exactly the same just wait a couple days and you'll feel it and at
the same time you feel like I'm doing completely better with exercise and you
stopped exercising then you're going to go down again in a couple days be
consistent with your exercise also your sleep cycle is so important
try to go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time every night and get
enough sleep if you get enough sleep and you exercise you're helping your brain
so much and you're really really doing a lot to get yourself mentally healthy
what's hard about depression is you have to stop listening to your emotions you
can only trust them anymore if my body's telling me I'm not hungry or I'm really
tired it's probably alive if my body is like I don't want to go workout it's
like to fight against that anyways and it's so counterintuitive because you
know are higher lines we trust our emotions if we're getting sick our body
will feel more tired will need to sleep for and so fighting against those
intuitions and those signals from your body it's so counterintuitive and it's
so difficult for me I figured maybe if I just let myself rest more all feel
better but no like if you have to pressure if you continually liens that
it's going to keep in worse and worse and worse and just keeps by with
spiraling down route the best advice was in a youtube video i watched at the time
it felt really invalidating really harsh but the girl was saying just like get
out of bed and go do stuff and she was like you have the power to go change and
at the time I was like no like I literally cannot but you can it's a
mental block and of course it's so difficult but you do have more power
than you realize and I think now that i'm aware of all this when I feel my
depression coming back I immediately liked fight against to go workout go out
with people who really helped me so much
where some of my friends who we would go out and get food together and we work
out together and they would be so happy and laughing and this was like the month
of May we hang out so much we go to the beach we would do applies for God's the
guys we would see she look we would just go into things and because they were
bringing along with them that was exactly what I needed and I feel like
this is something that you can get through on your own like you need to
tell people in your life what you're struggling with and hopefully they are
supportive and they asked tons of questions and try to understand all your
symptoms and what they can do to help
I had some friends who would say things like let me know if you need anything
but then when the time came to wear like I couldn't do dishes or I really needed
someone to help me wake up in the morning or I need someone to feed me
it's like they didn't want to do that and so if you have a friend who's
struggling with depression understand that helping them will come in very like
tangible ways it's not going to be like oh I need a hug because for most people
depression isn't this like emotional sadness is that there is no no problem
underlying problem to fix is just day-to-day like we need help just like
going and doing things
and getting outside and going to restaurants and going to the beach like
that sort of stuff is what really helped me and that wasn't me doing and all my
friends dragging me along and just being themselves and being so happy and loving
I remember praying lot in May at my depression would go away before i left
for thailand for missions trip because I knew it
there's no way I would be able to get through that I had no energy and it's
like God into that prayer requests way in advance by putting these friends in
my life will help me the most when I was feeling really misunderstood is watching
people youtube videos talking about depression and also with just being blog
entries and random stuff online people sharing their experiences and knowing
that I'm not the only one with felt this and dealt with this and live with this
it's just that feeling of being understood and not being the only one
feeling that is really really comforting so I wrote a blog post on my website I'm
going to link below and I went more in-depth on depression symptoms and what
it looks like it feels like to have depression i express myself way better
through writing and i think it's going to be called depression isn't because
there's always preconceived notions about what it looks like and what it is
how you get it i'm going to link that below go read it
message me or get in contact with me somehow if you have to press it because
I know what you're going through and I got with through treatment and I got
back to being myself and it took a long time and so if you're thinking about
whether or not to go to get treatment like go ASAP let go as soon as possible
because it's not going to go away if anything it will get worse and then
continued to get worse and then say that way for like almost a year and so I'm
your only options are just continuing to get worse and not taking care of
yourself and just wasting your life basically or like going actually getting
help
i'm probably going to make some following videos
talking about depression and different aspects of it just because it makes me
angry looking back how ignorant I was about it and how it took so long to
realize what was wrong with me and so I really hope this video has helped you
recognize what depression is and if not in yourself and a friend are able to
recognize it if it happens i love you all so much and I'll see you next video
bye
