hi guys welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to doing a very different and
very personal video that I've been planning on doing for a while and I kind
of put it off and I was like no I don't want to do it
I don't cry and then I was like yes Emily you don't know who else is out
there who might need some relational in singles like I can relate i feel your
pain you're not alone i want to kind of do that more than give advice because I
realized with watching the other people's videos and growing up myself
that often being told like what to do or what not to do kind of like the opposite
of what people need especially when you're young and you're impressionable
and you don't really know what's right or what's wrong
so I wanted to talk about three things that i'm going to group together and
basically my experience with these three things and how they kind of related to
one another so as you can tell by the title
we're going to talk about stress anxiety and depression I want to be as open as i
can tell you guys because I feel like when you watch someone and they're
totally like guarded or like there's certain things they don't like to
discuss with you
it puts like some sort of like I don't even want to say it but I almost taints
the relationship the viewer video maker relationship which doesn't make any
sense but to me it does i recently was watching a video from someone that I
don't want you anymore but I was watching a video of them and they're
talking about a topic that really upset me like just upset me in general that
someone would feel like because they have all these describers that you're
allowed to go out and say these things about things you don't understand really
is what it was
I'm just gonna I'm just going to assume we can hear that there's literally like
a car alarm going off and you don't hear ok basically what i want to say by
saying that then I watched else's video and it bothered me was that saying your
opinions is a very scary thing to do social platforms like YouTube because
people can twist your words people can take offense to it at the end of the day
everyone has different opinions or different experiences and I think it's
so awesome that we get to share our opinions and I think it's so awesome
that other people have different viewpoints and i do but i also think
it's really important that we don't put each other down for what they think or
what they've been through I watch a lot of videos of people and I am see that
blogging and all this stuff is very stressful for people that they'll crying
videos and then I see people in the comments being like why are you crying
like your life is so easy and done . so i just wanted to sort of say before I go
deeper into this like basically the gist of it is you never know what someone's
story is you never know like what someone else is going through a blog you
know even this video right now you're only seeing a little portion of my life
a little portion of my day and a little bit that I want to share with you guys
take this with a grain of salt
this is just my opinion my experience with these things because I know these
are serious topics and oftentimes when people make these videos a lot of like
like negative attention that surrounds it and I don't want that I don't want
someone feeling all poor you i feel bad for you that you've gone through that no
that's not what I want from this what I want for you guys to learn from my
mistakes and not to the things that I do basically i have had probably and I
don't want to cry this video I refuse a very emotional person i will cry on
command
um I've had a very rough like six months or so i would say even longer than that
ever since I finished my first year of university i started working a new job
and I was working full-time and I think I kind of got worn out to be honest with
you guys and I know people are so hard on you know kids my age because we're
supposed to have like energy and this is what the time of your life and and all
this and your wallet is nice and I do enjoy it i'm also tired like very very
tired and you might have 10,000 more things and I do to deal with but i am my
own person and with what I'm dealing with
I was worn out doing to fall semesters of university and then working full-time
sometimes six days a week i was just white so by the time that I
started my next semester of university which was in September and that's my
second year which i'm just about done now I was exhausted and I didn't realize
it like physically because it wasn't fits a call it was definitely a hundred
percent emotional and just in my head I just felt tired so I also transferred to
a new school and that was huge for me the community my old school was about 15
minutes now i have to public transit and it took around an hour
that was a huge transition for me and by about october i was like completely worn
out and I've always been such a stress stressful person like I just I feel
stress very easily
I'm not very good at dealing with my stress i'll be completely honest with
you guys I wish I could be like this is what you do with your stress
I don't know I'm still figuring it out you took for me please
load the mommy I need them all but basically I was so stressed and I have
not felt that much stress ever um i have had anxiety I think everyone has a
little bit of anxiety about certain things whether even just the public
speaking
that's anxiety for me mine was all the grades I was so anxious about not doing
well in my classes that it was actually affected me in a negative way as you get
more anxious and more stressed out you know having panic attacks is not the
most pleasant thing i'll be completely honest and it is awful and I wouldn't
wish it on anyone and because you feel just completely helpless i had one over
K thanksgiving and it was so bad and I just felt like I said helpless i got
back my terms in october and I kind of felt better for a little while I think I
feel better for about two weeks or so and then it got worse again and I just
was so anxious and even a couple icicle you guys I had a little bit of like a
pre kind of panic attack you there's things that happen I mean a lot of time
we have so many thoughts going through my head and then I feel like you can't
breathe and I feel like there's so much it's like a weight just like sitting on
my chest and I had to talk to my dad and any if you didn't know my dad
is a therapist and so I talked to him and I said like you know this is what
I'm feeling i know i'm having panic attacks and i need help i need to know
like what I can do
breathing is the biggest thing in meditation and so I was trying yoga and
I was trying all the stuff yoga not for me but the breathing really really
helped me so that's something i really really recommend and then this just to
top it all off i kept getting like awful marks in my classes and I wasn't used to
it
okay i think it all started when I got a midterm back and I got 63 on it and I
thought the world was going to end like i straight-up student life I thought
that you know what
there goes everything I ever wanted you know my career that I want all these
marks count and that mark hurt not even just like my my grade point average
obviously her but it hurt me and for the first time I hold her life and I've
always been an extremely happy person once again have to not get emotional
it's hard for me to talk about because I never been like that it was like the
complete opposite of what I was Ben and that was the first time I felt depressed
like I actually felt like what's the point and it was so doesn't like an exam
did that to me
thanks but I'm totally honest but I'm the gist of it is it was just like
really I guess the fact alone that I like figured out like that was what was
going on in my head was I like it's almost snapped out of it to programs
like oh my god no like I won't go there you know I see the damage that
depression can do to people there was a boy in my high school great suicide and
I see it the effects of depression on people and I don't want to let myself
slip into that know people are born with its genetic and I completely believe
that but I also wanted to have control over that i personally have never been
that going
dealing with these bad unfortunate things that have happened in my life and
therefore i had this two or three week-long just so unhappy so unhappy
I remember like coming home one night and literally crying for like three
hours and what was the point of me I didn't even know why I was crying like I
like birthday bunch of capillaries in her eyes and so I had like red dots
under my eyes and my eyelids and I just felt really helpless i think that's the
biggest word i'm going to use this video like helpless because it feels like you
have no control over what is going on in your life and for me when I had to do in
order to kind of step out of it was I had to realize that there's so much in
my life that I do have control over might feel like I don't have control
over but i really do I have control over how much effort I put into something may
not have control over what the outcome is what great that yet but i do have
control over you know how much ever I put in there or how happy I can be no
matter what more do i get if there's something or someone that's in your life
or that was in my life that you know was creating toxic miss just toxic thoughts
and feelings then get rid of them like don't you don't need that in your life
like things that are source of stress you know at this point in my life I have
the ability where I can get rid of them
you know one day when I have a career and I'm working with someone who I don't
really like you know I might not have the option to just leave but for now i
do what i learned through that experience and i'm still learning i'm
still I still have like darker days where I just feel very negative my dad
even said this to me what you need right now is not to be alone even though
that's what you want that's not what you mean what you need to be around other
people and it totally was true my parents are very they've never been a
parent all kind of parent they've been more friends to me and in that moment
that's what I needed
I'm not going to say that it's gone forever and I'm never gonna do it again
I'm sure something crappy is gonna happen later on my life and I'm going to
be like well here we are again but I've gone through once and I know now what I
need to do to fix it especially for my anxiety like a lot of what I do is deep
breathing and just peaceful thoughts for me I really struggle with seeing
positive and anything so what I do instead of thinking positive thoughts
that count and it really does call me down so I don't know if any of you guys
have anxiety and deal with panic attacks but for me the definitely accounting
really helps and just closing my eyes and trying to relax and just calm myself
down when i first have panic attacks i could not deal with them by myself like
I had to have someone call me down but now i'm much better i never thought that
i would be that person making a video on youtube about having panic attacks and
may be dealing with a little bit of depression and really struggling doing
my stress but like i said from the very beginning and what I've always said you
guys I want to be as honest as possible with you as I can
the experiences that I go through i will share with you just if there's even the
slightest chance that some of you can learn from it and that's what I really
want
it's such a like private topic and I feel like I don't want that I don't want
these things to be like so embarrassing and I was embarrassed when I first felt
like so upset and just unhappy I I was embarrassed and I never thought I would
talk about having anxiety
I know so many people deal with the two and that's the biggest thing i want to
be able to show you guys that you're not alone at all the other thing was I
didn't have any motivation to do anything anymore
at that point so I didn't really want to do youtube I didn't really want to see
people so i was really encouraging family to continue with YouTube and
continue doing it because at the end of the day I do love it and at the end of
the day does make me happy and it is my creative outlet and I i need it so yeah
as much as you guys enjoy my videos I need them in order to stay saying also
wanted to kind of tell us the whole story because a lot of you guys coming
my videos saying that you come to watch me because you in
join my bubbly personality and you enjoy how I'm happy I always seem and all this
and like I said at the beginning of the video you know you're only seeing a tiny
bit of my day
yes generally I have a pretty peppy bubbly outgoing person but there are
days when i'm like like i don't talk and I'm quiet and shy and then there are
situations when I like that too
I don't want to pretend like I'm always fine and happy because that's just
unrealistic that is my story
I hope you all enjoyed another city was long and maybe you didn't even get to
the very end which that's ok but the the gist of it is that I went through
something and I'm you know I'm recovering and I'm feeling a lot better
and I feel like there are things in life that are worth living for
and I think that's the biggest thing there are things that I don't want to
miss out on whether that be one day being a mom which is something that I
have always dreamed of or even just finishing university that my degree all
these things i don't want to miss anything at all so that's everything I
hope you guys enjoy this video leave your experiences if you want down below
and your thoughts and feelings and i will see you all very soon however
