yeah
I was trapped inside the prison of my own mind my thoughts were clouded with
negativity depression is something people don't want to talk about because
it shows weakness and in a society where we pretend everything is perfect
photoshop not only our photos but our lives
I swore was no I swore that how I thought in the perception of myself as
who are really was that I didn't deserve not only happiness but I didn't deserve
to live and work work work
I'm stung I'm got all thought patterns is stapled in my mind and anything you
tell yourself your subconscious will begin to believe it is true there's a
big difference from contemplating taking your life and actually doing it
but at this moment gun in my hand
thinker squeezed against the trigger
hopelessness in my heart
and numerous social media posts for seeing this inevitable moment I was as
good as dead from heart is stopped
I thought about everything
friends
family
the family I never started
supporters
people are let down
that made me
man
all that matter was relieving myself from this seemingly endless torture
this was it the answer to all my problems
I would finally be at peace
pull the trigger don't be a bitch
pull the goddamn trigger voices in my head
do we do it
and that's when I have it good
born with a good
I've never believed in miracles until that moment
suddenly my life had meaning again
honestly I've never been more grateful
I've never been more alive
I feel blessed to say
I'm still here
