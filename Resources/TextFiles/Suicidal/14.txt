it started off with me having ongoing depression for two years and the reasons why we're 
me getting bullied and I always had this thing where I blame stuff on myself 
like I don't even know why the little things that would happen not even to me I just blame it on myself 
and it's like it didn't start getting self destructive till about 
the age of like thirteen when I first turn thirteen I started really 
cutting myself never really little 
but there were a lot of them they brought paper cuts all over my arm 
and 
they went all the way up to here 
and 
you know I got bullied a lot too I don't believe because I was considered senior imo 
and stuff and they don't like my hair in the like the way I dressed they didn't like 
anything on me I guess I always had like 
before had been nose or whatever 
fat face and stuff and I still remember the people who called me this 
and it move 
I mean like think about it %HESITATION anyways 
so 
not me me even more upset than I was and I made some friends 
with common interest but 
few months later I guess they changed how they were and stuff and they change their style so 
they moved on and stuff and 
didn't like the way I dressed either even though they just like that like a couple months ago but 
who knew %HESITATION 
yeah so lost those friends and I made a long term friend 
let's name him Bob because I don't wanna 
specifying any names just in case of persons watching this %HESITATION yeah 
so I mean a long term friend named Bob and 
you know meaning really close we were friends for like three years 
and 
you know 
he'd be the type of person the light tease me though like Disney has joking for way like jokingly but 
I take it offense I guess because I was really sensitive and I and I never really told them about it 
so I just like bottled my feelings and just like cry 
and I you know while was this sensitive softly 
like why does this happen in you like why am I so like depressants of like why does this happen to me or my gosh 
and that the person that depression started interfering with my grades and my grades dropped and my grades dropping led to my parents getting mad 
and being aware 
of my depression because I had to tell them and 
it was just like this whole thing just hit me in the fucking face like 
everything was hitting me in the face and I was so stressed 
about school I was so stressed about people making fun of me my appearance everything losing friends 
left and right in just everything hurt and my parents actually didn't believe me at first because they thought I was too young to be depressed 
and that just made everything worse 
and like 
eventually my Kening got really severe and I started having deep cuts on my thigh 
I got deeper and deeper each time 
so I got sent to a mental hospital and 
it's a it's like one of those hospitals that 
help emotionally unstable people I guess people problems and I stood there for a week overnight and I only got to see my parents twice on the visitation and stuff and I met 
a roommate there that's actually still my friend to this day but 
ya and 
after that I stopped cutting for about three weeks and then I relapsed and I started cutting all over again and I thought it stopped and it didn't even though I'll I got put on meds whenever I went to the hospital I got put on Prozac and then I got switched on Lexapro and then I also got plans and mood stabilizers 
exiles bipolar I guess 
and I bottom put on insomnia medicine because I had no sleep like this just got so bad that I couldn't even sleep so they put me on that medicine and 
yeah so I was still cutting and 
I got so tired of people hating on I cut it like my family I was disappointing my family left and right 
that I started I turned to different things and I was smoking 
I smoked a cigarette and I was like you know like this is better than cutting so I quit cutting completely 
and I start smoking 
and I was like you know this isn't as bad as cutting yourself because people won't know you know you can't tell 
even if you smoke like one cigarette a day I guess I that's what I thought 
I can't tell from outside 
let's my did and I started smoking weed then and I was like 
%HESITATION they those is really bad 
Esther smoking weed and 
a 
my parents found out that late I was smoking and I got in a lot of trouble and that just made my depression go down fucking hill 
I hit rock bottom 
and I was so unstable 
and just 
sorry my sister Texan and I might try to see what she said but also unstable and one day I just got 
tired of it 
and I took 
a lot of sleeping pills like a why 
it was more than a 
I does more than seven because I remember counting the seventh one 
and then I just said fuck it and then I pour the rest and I took a 
and I woke up a day later like exactly like around twenty four hours later and I was like 
I hate my life like I tried to kill myself 
and I ended up waking a day later and it soon as they woke up I went to the bathroom 
throughout 
like I was just sick to my stomach 
I got dehydrated and I need to be hospitalized 
and they noticed 
I guess 
and yeah 
so 
that happened 
and 
you know ever since that happened 
I've just been like 
still struggling like I'm honestly still struggling with these types of things and 
Blake it's hard you can just get rid of depression in one day you know 
like 
you can't just say %HESITATION leave and stuff and it'll disappear no it doesn't work like that it takes a lot of time 
and 
a it was so bad and kind of like I will be honest to this day 
like 
I'm kind of still isolate myself because 
I prefer sleeping then hanging out with friends to be honest and it sounds as like as not as it sounds 
you know it's what I do and 
I don't know 
really bad so
