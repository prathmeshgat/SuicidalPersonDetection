basically i'm making this video for those who don't understand why people
are depressed and have depression why people who have fame and money and all
that kind of stuff and I'm not even saying i have that I'm just saying in
general people don't get it they're like why you have family your friends your
everything
why are you depressed you know they don't get it and I'm going to try my
best to explain it by and do something i'm just gonna bring out I was not for
attention and if you think it is just just get off the video just you're just
wasting your time basically what I'm gonna be talking about is my depression
my self harm my suicide attempt and not only am I going to show that part of it
i'm going to show the other part of how I came to be this peaceful person hand
today so the biggest part and I'm mainly doing this for the people who are
struggling and who think that it's not going to get better and who think
they're going to be depressed the rest of their lives because that's literally
what i was thinking but I'm here to tell you by proof by experienced by real-life
situations that it is possible to get through it and now I'm not asking for
any pity at all so don't go thinking like oh my god I'm always gonna have my
breakdowns my bad days that's normal as human what I went through is completely
different and I'm never going to experience that again basically like
don't feel bad for me at all like I'm happy I'm great enjoy this video and
enjoy my experience when I went through because you know everything is good
experience was also saying is about experience to me
nice going to my childhood a little bit and just like throughout my whole life
like I had a great childhood you know great family friends everything you know
but one thing in my life it's still important to me but I've you know
maintained a level of what I do with it
friendships when I was a kid when i was in middle school when i first started
high school friendships or everything to me and when I was a child growing up I
was very outgoing and problems with friends did happen situations which led
me to being into this program that i'm very shy so basically in middle school I
craved attention i craved friendships friendships from anyone like i loved
making friends i logged the popularity so I had a great room
I think I seven an ingrate obviously like your popularity became more
important when you're in grade eight you know it's a last year of middle school
everything kinda just went into real big groups of people and like I don't know
what it was really like I don't really remember trying to figure it out right
now I just want to go up there you know I want to be friends with everyone
wanted to do all that kind of stuff basically got really cocky about it got
talking about the fact that I had friends I didn't notice i took it for
granted i did not realize i had such amazing friends because I just wanted
more i didn't care about quality
I care about quantity so I'm great seven and 8i have a best friend she was like
my sister you know we did everything together wasn't a day I wasn't talking
to her with her i was with her every single day every single class together
I got selfish i was jealous i got manipulative and I kept secrets from her
and I betrayed her just so i can get more attention from others and make more
friends anyways towards the end of my great year i ended up losing her because
the various problems at first it didn't hit me you know the first couple days we
weren't hanging out I was just like okay maybe I should take a little break and
i'll leave it alone and then it became a pattern every single day I wasn't with
her every single day I was in this sadness like I was sad and mad every
single day i was with my other friends that I don't usually hang out with and
people would come up to me said oh like oh you're with her now I haha you lost
her and people would say these things to me any just got to me so so much and no
one knew it was killing the inside I was just remember this one time I was just
sitting there with my friends and I couldn't stop thinking about it I can't
I didn't even think that end up crying and it was just so painful and I know it
sounds stupid like oh I lost a friend but you honestly don't understand what
someone goes through until you're in it like obviously people
oh my god why am i crying so do not judge anyone in don't judge me because
my problem isn't as bad as yours or because there's people dying and like
any I'm understand is worse situation than me obviously there it's in this
lesson we're situations I mean but everyone has their own shit and it
doesn't matter what the level is if it's bad it's bad that's it and it's all your
perspective in your mindset and how you look at it doesn't matter what it
actually is
I hope that made sense to depression hit me really hard
I just thought everything was my fault that I was so jealous every time I would
see here with other people I didn't tell anyone about this like people knew i was
sad obviously but no one no one knew how bad it was and no one would believe me
if I said how bad it was that I was literally in pain pain was worse than a
physical pain that's how that's what depression is not physical pain but it
feels like it is it feels like hell it's just it's horrible
honestly I made the problem worse myself of course I did I could have easily like
like change my mindset my perspective god help with they got a counselor
therapist whatever i could have easily done something about it but i did it i
was sitting there sad and crying every day and just putting myself through it
every single day
now like I said I did have other friends and they were there in everything and it
was great you know I had someone to distract me like hang out with and all
that problem just kept getting worse and i'm not saying with this one friend only
i'm saying i ended up like I had I was counting that's how that's how like
that's how I grew up in middle school and towards the end of elementary school
I lost so many friends I would count them i would write them down how many of
gloss like throughout grade 5 grade sixth grade 7 and then great and
upgraded like I'm talking about right now and you're losing basically all of
them and i was invited down now we just look at it and I'm like fuck I hate
myself like I would just put myself in that position put myself as this victim
as this not worthy person at this point i literally thought it would just never
and now when I first self-harm I honestly don't remember how I even knew
about it basically my opinion I think so far as anything you use purposely to
harm yourself whether it's alcohol whether it's drugs and hating yourself
and calling yourself stupid everyday land for me obviously the worst thing is
cutting no one you
now cutting i really want to explain it but I live don't even remember because
it's been over a year since i've done it so this is what it was for me it was
like I was in pain so I would do it and instead of focusing my pain and my
energy on my problems i was just focus on that cut that was all i could in a
felt good because i don't have to think about my situation because those are
completely worse for me cutting was like for depressed people for people who do
cut its it it's nice a nice feeling and I don't want to stay like oh don't do it
like it
do not do it because you're going to end up with scars that you have to see every
single day and it's not worth it and it is painful I mean obviously it's painful
but when you're going through at the time it's like this feeling of your free
you or I'm just saying like if you ever judge someone for cutting for attention
why what why would you touch them for that you think people are hurting
themselves so you can go say hey like no no i didn't i was the one thing i knew
for sure i didn't do that for attention
it was just something you know i don't know how i found out i tried it so good
and I kept doing it and it would distract me from everything and not
explain but don't do it
definitely I'm not promoting it the hardest part is definitely covering it
up and trying to stop and what i do recommend for those who are feeling in
pain obviously we all feel pain sometimes distract yourself with
something good in your life something you like to do a good hobby a healthy
whatever-it-is sports singing dancing whatever the fuck it is that is good and
good for you that's the best distraction the best happiness you get from anything
things that you love i can remember cutting the day before my grade
graduation ceremony thing I put so many bracelets and makeup over it
no one noticed it has made my day worse because i had to see it when summer
started and obviously it's really hard to cover because when it's summer so I
stopped taking the whole two months of my summer was a complete distraction
from my depression and every time it came up to me I would just completely
ignore it and not in a good way because it wasn't gone i was ignoring it so i
started the first two days you know they're fun they're great and I don't
know what happened all the sudden everything just came crashing down again
i started cutting again I was a pressed again I hated everything just everything
just sucks i had a couple friends here and there were always know just there
for me and stuff I'd only had one best friend that was really close to me and
one day I just kind of told her about my depression i don't know why i don't
remember how I told her it was really supportive and everything that you want
to help me and that's the best thing you can do for someone honestly lessons i
did have a negative mind and my perspective everything was just shit and
I remember i'm also my cuts one day she just freaked out and took me to the
doctors and obviously the doctors and dreams like a you see fucking there's
only one told you want me to do about it so don't remember them doing anything
that I just remember a lot of judgment and a lot of fighting and that judgment
for my parents was the worst thing ever and it made my situation my problem my
depression so much more worse and I don't blame them i mean it's not like
they get it like they've been through it . they thought i was just playing them
like using them just so I could get more things from them and make them feel bad
or something and I don't blame them and I forgive him obviously now but at that
time I was hard and judgment from parents is can really affect the kid
that went to break happen and it seems like every time there's a windbreaker
summer break a break from school of break from reality and
when I'm with people all the time like people I like and good energy i get good
energy obviously energy passes from people in my winter break was really
good i don't want to say really good because I do remember still cutting I
was really happy with people with people I surround myself with and they were
people who didn't even go to my school so that's something i really liked but I
knew the second school started again i will be feeling like shit and that's
exactly what happened I couldn't handle it anymore i'm like no i can't live like
this
I didn't think it would get better when i was going to my depression just the
from the very beginning ingredient when I had depression i felt was the end of
my life so yeah it was the first week
january $MONTH 2013 was a Wednesday night
there's stuff from school and then I gotta fight with my parents and then I
really don't want to blame this person I'm not pointing fingers or anything I'm
know I'm by myself for what I did actually cutting at this time I remember
kind of when this person texted me this person I used to be really close with
you should have problems with each other and that person was the only person who
kind of understood the level of pain I was feeling related to each other we
helped each other out and something happened in that percent up hating me
first of all the text message i did not the person number anymore so just a
number and it said I hope to cut yourself bitch
like what I was like what the fuck i was really shocked because I don't know what
the person was writing a random number i'm like who is this
and then they say nobody likes you and just stuff like that and link i hope you
caught in blah blah i was like what the fuck great so I asked my friend like
whose number is this
and then she tells me I was like oh my god it really hit me like I'm fucking
done like I've caused so much stress for people I you know like I'm stress for
and everyone's life because of what I'm going through
I can't change what I'm going through and I can't help it so I just went
downstairs grabs a couple pills and I took them
and I was going to take more actually goes on my way to get some more and then
my dad walks in my room he saw the pills he talks and like everything worked out
action I was like okay you know he cares i could never do this to myself I could
never hurt someone this bad you know so I was like okay right
like totally forgot she took pills before I didn't even think it would hit
me right so we took that pill the way obviously and i just went straight to
bed right and this was this is January night the day i'm uploading this i don't
know why i wanted to do it the exact date
I just don't know basically that was my attempt of suicide two years ago today
my guys basically this day marks the day that I'm alive in the Melfi I'm living
yeah so I got up in the morning i was getting ready for school and then I was
just in everything and all of a sudden I started getting dizzy kind of fainted a
little bit i was calling dynamically fog like that community I told him I'm like
I took a bunch of pills before you came back in 39 my friend would pick me up
one of my other close friends was actually my best friend right now the
moment she would pick me up every morning for school right and we forgot
to tell her to come and so she came and then obviously my mom had to tell her
what happened I guess you told ya mama told her what happened and yeah that
happened was really random and it was a really shitty feel like there's an
ambulance coming
there's please car though their little police talking to us for some fucking
reason and I mean yeah into the hospital i remember what happened they did some
sherry end up sleeping the whole time and then a whole cup to see my other
best friend and my other friend is currently my best friend I open my eyes
and she's there she's crying
the fuck why are you here right like I don't think she knew what I was going
through I don't really remember isn't too close with her at the time and
obviously my mom told her about it that's what she came so yeah so about
the day I in job going to a psychiatrist at the hospital and honestly she was
fucking amazing and go to school for the next two days because i was i was
drained I was emotionally drained my friend and calling me because my sister
posted a picture of a police guard her in
Instagram where my best friend at the time i saw it was following her she
calls me she's like I the police car outside your house and she was at school
at the time so you can really talk i was like I don't know like obviously she
gets it she's like did you fucking attempt and I'm like mm I was weird
though I did have a good couple weeks after that the focal love and all the
attention again stuff that people should feel everyday and it sucks that I didn't
feel it but of course I don't know what happened again again I was all the press
together started cutting again blah blah and every time I parents will see me
kind they were taken to the hospital and fucking just so stupid honestly like
just a do not a handle and I don't blame but was not a fun ride it was not fun
basically it out my entire gray nine-year completely hating myself
completely hating everything around me
yeah I lost how many good people do that now what I really look back in migraine
nine-year it was a good year I just didn't make it a good one
I could have been a really good year respective is really key guys mindset
way you look at things there's no such thing as good or bad it's so what you
receive what you see from it
choose to make a good or bad so basically after my ten my parents ended
up getting the psychiatrist and psychologist and like all these like
riding with a bunch of therapist but I didn't end up liking any of them had
this one psychiatrist who actually was really annoying was ready not everything
was saying I didn't like it that wasn't sharing much anyways and I was not being
open at all and she ended up saying that i had depression like as an illness and
give me into the presence and introducing them for a couple months and
I don't remember why I stopped really my parents just doing it to me so that
happen really though you cannot cure anything with a negative line that
doesn't go with depression goes with everything in life at that point I was
like a I'm daunting more psychologists and psychiatrists and therapists and
counselors whatever i'm done and then they are in love
letting go of someone who meant a lot to me because I didn't want any
distractions and I was ready to just find myself I guess you
cover just find myself and do it by myself because I'm a very independent
person I like doing things by myself I like doing things on my own
obviously it wasn't a smart idea of going through depression to do things on
your own
the last time I self-harm was in june 2013 which was almost two years ago and
I'm very proud of that and the last time i did it actually was the worst time
time I did a lot like it did not stop and when I was done I was like I need to
stop this
this is getting crazy I can't believe I did it so much I get it was to the point
where i still have a scar on my arm still there from the last time i did it
i think it was an internal last time I don't remember i have a bunch though but
most of them you can see and the one where you can really see no one's ever
said anything about it though i know they see you but I guess it's nice
definitely i do not recommend cutting do not cut but she have no choice and it is
there
think of it as a good reminder if you have it reminder that you did it all
through that bowel that shit you went through your life through all that you
went through here they're here
you're living mainly why I made myself stop again was because it was summer and
that was you know I'm not gonna do it from summer basically had a good summer
I had another friend where got close with again and it was really good summer
if you watch my video of when I shave my head which you can click here
that's what it was in August shave my head and I actually felt really free and
it was awesome video may only make some sense them but I mean if so want to
watch it one obviously identity because soon the feeling of freedom feeling of
choice of my own summer was over and great 10 king school can i'm not going
to talk about this because basically I talk about my entire group 10-year and
everything I went through again in my other video where it's called why
dropped out of high school basically I got to the point where i distracted
myself every time I felt the need to cut and more of the self-harm and
distraction did come from weed and alcohol and partying and it was in that
extreme but it was it was all distraction you know that's really what
it is distraction just escape from reality and no more pain but anyways
that's not the end of my awesome story though
I'm just getting started just beginning of when i learned to love my beautiful
existence
basically if you watch my other video but anxiety and all that i ended up
getting a caster I loved her she was amazing
basically it ended up to seeing her in less than seven months and my life i'm
going to change which is really crazy considering that it took me like a whole
year I couldn't figure myself out but I could've in just seven months i know i
understand myself better image and everything else in the world better and
but i was still in my comfort zone and that's when i was introduced to psy
basic seminar which you can click the video for that here or i explained and
that just changed my life
how many person like I'm a reborn reborn person after that seminar
that's all I'm going to say and you really never stop growing you never saw
blogging and I'm never going to stop finding myself learning more about
myself and just learning to be a piece every single day with my life and going
for the things i love it if it's scary whatever it is you do what you love and
everything will come together if you believe it i was lucky enough to have
people who care enough about me to go get me a counselor but if you don't have
that kind of support that's okay you can do it yourself i'm telling you i'm
giving you that support to go and get yourself help if you need it because it
was like can you do it's going to work out
you just gotta believe in yourself and your mindset of your vision of what you
want in your life and it's gonna happen all i can really set you know and the
proof is I think having proved to myself is really enough for me three years ago
today i never thought i would be feeling that this happiness of this piece and
this level i am I never thought I didn't think I would ever feel this way and to
think it was only two years ago
it feels like a long time ago in the same time is so sick of it was not that
long ago the same time you know but life man trust your instinct trust intuition
trust your intention and everything will work out driving yourself people who you
love and appreciate them and love them and tell them you love them and yeah and
remember if you do have a friend that's going through depression or something
like that
remember that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves so I
know that was the main thing with me i always thought you know why isn't my
friends helping me more you know why don't they do something about it but
really end of the day I wasn't helping myself so why should they helped me and
I love you and I'm always here for you and anything you want help with advise
whatever i'm here and asking anonymously on tumblr from water bra and yeah that's
pretty much hit that was a really long video thank you so much for watching
thank you for listening i love you and I'll see is actually I like it
because you know right
