well I was going on my hair is like so fluffy right now it's like full
particulars hi how's it going on so today i will be making a video that's
probably not the most pleasant topic to be talking about but I thought it'd be
something i should talk about anyways because it kind of just want to show the
like when you hit rock bottom and when you feel like you're at like there's no
other options and stuff like that things can still kind of go up because i think
i'm doing a lot better than i was when i was like you didn't really really bad
obviously and down
I just want to share a little bit like they attempted to kill myself and commit
suicide i'm just going to show that you know like you can get better from these
points and I know a lot of people make these videos this is pretty typical but
I thought I just shared anyway and it's not the most pleasant topic to be
talking about obviously but you know and everything else find this triggering
just don't watch this video please I don't want anyone to be triggered by
this and I don't want it to be making you guys feel really bad or anything so
I'm gonna trigger warning in the title
even though i consider all my videos to generally have a trigger warning like
people were saying like all why don't you put your warning on your videos and
I'm like I'm little channel kind of need to trigger warning to be honest if
that's what you mean but you know I kind of just don't bother putting trigger
warning the title because it makes the title boring characters long and then
also just cuz i already kind of like I actually put in the description of my
channel that like I consider my channel to have a general trigger warning on it
because I talk about things like self-harm and suicide and stuff like
that so i don't know i don't try and my voice sounds kind of funny right now I'm
not really sure why I just been having a really crunchy voice lately i call it
crunchy but it's like I don't know what the actual word with you for that i
guess like crackly
I don't know but whatever but my wife is just sounded really weird right now so I
don't really know what's going on with that I think it's just allergies on that
because even though it's only like the beginning of march there's like I don't
know all the flowers and I've start blooming and stuff like that so that all
the pollen is like attacking me and making me feel like I'm choking to death
oh my god my through but anyways down so that's basically what I feel like right
now anyways
so basically leading up to the events of this was probably i guess this was in
November 2013 i think that would have been that this all happened yeah
november two thousand thirteen i think that would have been or december
november december two thousand thirteen that this all happened if you guys are
wondering um so basically remember 2013 i was in a program treatment
I really really didn't like being a day program treatment like I just really
hated it and it wasn't a good time for me and like I felt like I shouldn't even
be there like it made me just feel like triggered and like because i was there
mostly for my self harm in like believe me on stuff like that so I wasn't
extremely skinny at the time and there were some people there that were really
skinny so it was really triggering for me it would make me feel really bad
about myself because I feel like oh I'm here but I don't even like me to be here
because i'm not skinny enough to be here and like that some have talked about
before like being skinny enough to go into treatment which isn't on all the
case like it's just like it's just something that like you feel like when
you have any views or I think if you feel like that no matter what you just
kind of feel like I'm not skinny enough to be in a treatment program and it
feels really bad but like I don't know it's just something like you kind of get
in your head when you have an eating disorder that you're not skinny enough
all the time so that obviously i didn't think i was skinny enough to be a
treatment program i don't think i was really like super skinny at the time
anyways like I wasn't really underweight or anything like that but though I can
understand the reason they thought i should be there because i was purging
like all the time so it kind of makes sense but I'm so like basically i was
there and i kind of felt like I didn't need to be there so it was really hard
for me and I was feeling trigger constantly by the whole situation like I
just felt like it was really wrong for me to be there and it was making me feel
even worse about myself honestly Sophie and a treatment program was really
really hard for me okay i think i mentioned that before like de trabajar
and was not a fun time and it was really difficult and I didn't enjoy it at all
it was just extremely hard and it just made me feel completely awful i was
cutting off a lot of the time and for some reason they said part of the reason
i need to be there was because of my self harm issues but they didn't help me
with those are all and I don't really know why but like basically i would come
there and they would way you like and they would like make me take off my
sweater and stuff and they could see like all these are fresh cuts and stuff
and they'd be like oh you stop doing that and then like they wouldn't do
anything about it like what the fuck like come on now
like they just wouldn't do anything about it at all and they were just kind
of like ignore the situation i don't know why i like they're supposed to be
there to help you and I know it's mostly an eating disorder treatment but like
come on like I was having issues so i don't know why they weren't happy with
that
like I feel like you didn't like a counselor or something should talk to
you about those things there but I don't know apparently no one was talking about
my self harm issues so i don't really know what that thing was going on there
but it was really dumb basically so they were talking about myself farmers use my
self harm was extremely bad at the time and I was like cutting myself constantly
that's what I ended up with most of the scars i actually have my arm which is
kind of annoying
I have like a ton of these scars that are called white now a great here and
like they get really wrinkly when I go like this and like I don't know they're
just very wrinkly scars but I'm anyways that's like completely besides the point
on what was I saying
I remember now oh yeah they were really help my self harm issue so that was just
getting worse and worse honestly because i was also in this treatment program
that i really do like so it was feeling bad caught something like the feeling
like I was like I felt like I was like losing like a little bit of my life in a
way because like I was basically i was in school at the time right because it's
november so i would have been in school and I should have been doing school work
and they said they would make us do school work there but they never really
made us do it and they would never really liked help us with it or anything
like that and i was really behind in school because i was missing all the
school right
and they were never really liked give us a lot of times you score because we're
always doing all these other things and like it was really done because like I
was getting so behind my schoolwork so I was constantly feeling really bad about
that so like first time constantly feeling bad about like self-harming and
then also constantly feeling bad about me even being there because i feel like
i shouldn't be there and I'm also feeling bad about my school work and
then like I'm also just feeling bad because i don't like like the counselor
and stuff they gave me and like basically what happened was like I had a
psychiatrist i have my psychiatrist I see all the time and i really like them
but this actress they gave me there was someone I really didn't get a wall with
so I was hating that too so I have these things and I'm also like just missing
out on life in general because when you're in a date remember it really
sucks because like you're basically they're all day and then you go home at
night and then you have like you know a couple hours where you go to bed and
then you have to be there in the morning again so basically like I wasn't seeing
Mike very much of the time either which was really hard for me because like I
need to see Mike all the time because i was like what am I going to do
I like I don't know it just made things even harder than I wasn't seeing Mike
because he's like my main support you guys have
we're gonna have talked about it all the time like he's just absolutely main
support right and so like I'm dealing with all this crap and I don't have like
my main support and I have all these things I just mentioned right so that
I'm feeling really bad and like things are just getting really hard so that one
day i go to the store and I like a big thing of like advil cold and sinus like
the ones you have to punch out to like the blister packs because i was at least
I can make a sudden decision I have to punch them all out but anyways so i take
home I advil and I punched them all out and I'm like okay I think I'm just gonna
lie kinda just take all these advils and hopes only happens and the thing is I
don't like a lot of people trying to commit suicide by taking advil and the
weird thing is it's basically the reason you kill yourself is because of damages
your organs and it's essentially like because you can like you are overdosing
on it but it's something that just your brain really like if you overdose don't
like some other medications but like it's basically that it damages your
organs so badly that you go into like liver failure and stuff
so essentially what happens is you take all this advil and you feel sick for a
while and then you start feeling better against really oh I guess it's been
working on the next day you're going to start feeling really shitty which is why
after this is what i've read about basically because i was kind of like
reading about this thing and like I know this is really triggering probably and I
don't really want to be talking about this because I feel like I'm trigger you
guys kind of but I don't know what really i'm just kind of trying to talk
about this and get off my chest because this is something i never really talked
about and the thing is like because i never really talked about this
it kind of just sits there like ways down on my chest all the time and it
feels like really good to be talking about this in a way with the same time I
feel kind of bad talking about it but I don't right now anyway so basically i
took a bunch of advil and I probably took like God knows how many i'm not
going to say exactly how many because that's the kind of 22 details and I
don't want anyone to like things like oh maybe I should take that many angles
because I don't want you guys to kill ourselves like obviously this is kind of
more to be like don't even like try it and just like when you hit rock bottom
try and get help instead because like what i did i didn't i didn't help people
is really suicidal the thing was like what i was going to the state trooper
him they would constantly be like are you feeling suicidal do you have a plan
blah blah and they would ask me those things that I would always lie and say
no select the thing is you just have to be honest if you're feeling that bad
just be honest if someone if you're like able to get help for it like please do
like if you're feeling suicidal get help like there's just no other way to do it
i think
if anyone's feeling like that you should just get help as soon as you can tell
somebody and get it off your chest and get some help for because it's better
than making an attempt because the thing was after me after I made an attempt I
felt even worse for a while so it really does get even
I gets a little bit harder after that happens you know and like so basically
I've done all this advil and then I was sitting in the bathtub and I mentioned
this in my draw my life video and I was like cutting myself and you know doing
my usual thing I was like maybe i'm just going to die and blah blah blah right
and then apparently Mike decides to call me right and he's like hey can we hang
out with Kyle tonight and I was like oh my i guess so what I'm already feeling
like oh now this is gonna go really bad because I said no one would be kind of
like oh why you really like seeing the operation work because i'm so into a
treatment program at the time
basically every day after day treatment program i like had to see Mike because I
missed him so much during the day that I like had to see him right
so you have been really weird out if I said no so I said yes and then basically
what I did because I was personal the time I like was able to just throw up a
majority of this medication or at least I think of was but like I think it was a
majority of the medication
so basically I pulled myself out of the bathtub and threw up a ton of this advil
and it was really gross because they were red and it came up all like weird
in red and like it was like half dissolved gel caps of advil and it was
pretty disgusting but I think I'm i think in a way that whole thing like
kind of save me because i think i probably could have died if I had kept
all that advil of my stomach but in a way like because um like just was able
to kind of pull me out of the situation I think I was like okay just because of
that and like basically what happened then was I went to Kyle's house and I
was with Mike in college we were just hanging out and then all of a sudden I
started to feel really really weird like I was hallucinating
I like things were just getting really strange and i think i might have
partially because advil cold and sinus and I'm not really sure if this is
normal
I'm not really sure what the fuck was going on here but like I started
hallucinating and I was like feeling so sick and I thought I was dying like I
literally thought I was dying I was like oh my god i'm actually gonna die I'm
gonna die at a friend's house I'm gonna die with my confirming and I want to die
just like this right now with pin here and like I'm feeling like terrible right
so I'm like feeling like I'm dying right and then that was some sort of my collar
just like holy shit like are you okay
like I can't really explain what's going on so I'm just like I don't really know
I don't know what's going on or why I feel like this because i don't want to
tell Mike what happened because I didn't want him to be upset you know so like I
didn't actually tell him what happened
so like I he knows now obviously otherwise wouldn't be able to find me
posting the video he know anyway but obviously have told him before posting
this video because i feel like it would be better to tell him first
rather than post a video about it and then be like oh yeah by the way um this
happened uh so basically I kind of just didn't really know what was going on and
I was feeling like so crazy was like the weirdest thing it was like the whole
room was like spinning and like things we just it was like it was like things
were on repeat like the whole like world was spinning and spinning and then it
was like it was like basically it felt like the world like the world would spin
and stuff what happened which is reset and then was spinning reset and spend
reset and like following that he felt the same thing was happening over and
over and then all of a sudden I feel like I'm gonna throw out Mike's like no
you're not going to throw up and i'm going to throw operate like I'm just
like oh my god I'm gonna throw up and then call it grabs a random pool with a
cup in the middle of that there's a full with the company and I like throw up and
I mention throw up exactly into the cup somehow i don't really know i might just
go like oh looks like you have broccoli for dinner and a host pick
seriously and so anyway so I got through out there that I felt better again and I
don't really know it was just a really weird situation because like I don't
know what happened there like what was going on I don't know if it was because
of like the medication that was still my body and that was making me like
hallucinate and things were going on weird and stuff like that and like I
don't really know what that like I don't remember a ton of that night like ups
I don't like a ton of what went on but like I don't know which is a really
weird situation
but anyway so then after that I went home and I felt fine and like I kind of
just like it was hard because I was kind of like well I'm a failure i can't even
kill myself right like I can't even like that happens to a lot of people who
tried to commit suicide and then like don't you know
do it right like not do it right but like it doesn't work and that's a good
thing when it doesn't work because it's better to not kill yourself
obviously so like if it doesn't work just like be happy that didn't work
because of my situation I was like oh I didn't work i didn't even kill myself
right like I can't even do it right like oh my god what was I thinking like
obviously I can't even kill myself right so why should I even bother
and then like so basically I was feeling even worse than that . because I felt so
bad about like failing that like I didn't tell anyone for the longest time
so it was something that really just like sat on my chest for ages like I
never told anyone
and so basically that's what happened and like it's a weird story to tell and
i'm glad i didn't start crying during this i'm probably gonna cry after God
knows on anyways so I'm gonna probably stop recording soon because I'm feeling
kind of like emotional about this whole situation and like I don't know it's
something that's hardly talk about but I just want to kind of show you guys like
look you can come back up from that like this was like almost this is like a year
and a bit ago basically because it's only beginning of 2015
but this is something that happened to me and like it was really like my rock
bottom . because i don't think i would have committed suicide or any attempted
to commit suicide and unless I was a complete rock bottom so i think that was
my like absolute rock bottom . and i think i'm doing so much better now and I
feel like I just kind of want to show you guys that you can go from feeling
like you need to kill yourself to feeling a lot better and getting into
recovery like when you're feeling that bad and you're feeling like at the point
where you're feeling suicidal you feel like it's never ever going to get better
and it's never you're never going to start recovering at no one thought
that's embarrassing
my voice is just totally dying here um you never feel like you're going to go
into recovery
you never feel like things are going to get better but i just want to show you
guys that when you're in that state and like I was in that state where I was
like recovery doesn't exist
I'm never going to get better things are just keep sucking until I end up killing
myself but thing basically i got better from that link . and like I got better
from that point and i managed to do it and its challenges shows that it is
possible in my like I just see that it shows that it is possible and i want you
guys to know that it's possible so i just want you guys to keep that in mind
for me because you're feeling like you're at that point where like you're
feeling suicidal because I got a lot of you guys are saying like hey I'm feeling
suicidal what do i do I don't know if I'm ever going to get better than this
it feel so hopeless now but i actually got to remember that it can get better
so i think you should just keep on trying like don't don't do anything
you're gonna don't do anything that's a permanent like decision makes it look
like suicide is essentially a permanent solution to a temporary problem i'm not
saying the depression or anything is temporary I'm saying that the feeling of
being suicidal is temporary because obviously I'm
I still have depression but I'm out of that state where I'm feeling suicidal
all the time so I think it proves that it does get better a little bit and I'm
semesters which is what i wanted to like tell you guys about and I'm hopefully
you guys kind of enjoyed this video even though is a little bit on the side side
not like the most pleasant topic to be talking about but I really just want to
like say like if you're feeling in that state that it does like you can get
better from that and it's all that it just like gets better it's just that you
can get into a state of recovery where you're able to deal with these things
more and if any of you guys are feeling suicidal
please do get some help and you don't even have to go to a person to get all
there's so many like there's like very suicide hotlines i'll link some of the
description below i'll try our only link to a page that has all the right stuff
like that because I just want you guys to be able to like get help and I don't
want anyone like killing themselves obviously because like I care about all
of you guys and committing suicide is just a horrible solution to a problem
that you can actually deal with in like a later time I know it feels like
impossible to deal with the time but like eventually you'll be able to do it
and I like believe in all of you guys and I just want you guys to all like get
better you know and I want you to get better with me because I've been getting
better since i've been making these videos and I want you guys to make that
progress with me so hopefully you guys enjoyed this and I'm just want you to
remember that you're all worth it and there's no reason to end your life
because you guys are all like great people and everyone has a purpose i know
you have to say like you feel like you're useless and you feel like you're
nothing but everyone has a purpose and ever will find a purpose so just
remember that like I those when I was feeling that that time when I was
feeling that bad i didn't know if i was going to graduate high school I don't
know if I was ever going to get a job
look at me out i have a full-time job and I've graduated high school and
college so like it really can change like things do get better in a way and I
don't want to say like all things don't ever get better truly but in a way I
feel like things have gotten a little bit better for me and it's really good
you know like I want things together for you guys to so all the guys enjoyed this
video and i will see you guys later
and i love you all and remember to stay strong and stuff like that so yeah bye
