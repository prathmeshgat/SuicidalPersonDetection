hey y'all ok so I know it's been a very long time since i made a video i believe
the last 1i meat was back in March that was what cable major in july-september
that was like six seven months ago and i just want to thank my subscribers
everybody who has emailed me and sent me messages on facebook checking up on me
make sure I'm okay in the beginning of this year i dealt with
oh crap very severe depression and I just have to take a step back i didn't
realize i would take such a long time away from YouTube but I'm just go ahead
and get this out the way starting to start making videos again because i know
people be asking questions would be like girl with what
so after I started to feel better you know I sought treatment got help which
is very important on it was kinda like I had to find I'm stuff is like I want to
do this video so that is not in my throat and I have a I feel like going to
cry so there with me this video might be shot because i might be anything a lot
of crap out
um yeah um I stepped away from making videos because I didn't want to be funny
and I didn't want to think and I felt like that that's where I was headed on
it was like I was putting a smile on my face and that was wearing my mask and I
was trying to be my normal job you'll happy self and let my personality shine
through when the inside it was like broken shards of glass and it was really
painful to do and actually even more people to watch like I look back and I
those videos that I've done when I was deep in depression and it just makes me
so sad because I was tending so hard and I wasn't letting anybody know where i
was going through and nobody knew how really sad i was and i kind of the
current I'm the kind of person where I grew up and I was raised to just get
over it on you know we didn't have time you know we didn't have time to devote
to getting help and seeking therapy and talking to a therapist and taking
medications know you get their food is because close need to be watched kids
need to be taken care of you know I don't know this is how I think a lot of
us are raised especially you know to be the strong black woman and there is a
stigma in the black community on when it comes to mental illnesses and depression
is an illness you know bipolar OCD all these different things and we don't
really talk about them you know when we talk about when we talk about them after
somebody commits suicide and there's been a lot of suicides this year some
very prominent ones and from people who you would never expect from people who
look like they had the whole world on a plate
they were beautiful they were intelligent they were smart in and just
my vacation and full of life and inspiring and seemed like they had
everything together so when you read that they just they they were battling
depression so severe that they just felt like there was no way out there was no
hope it's shocking it's shocking because you're like they on the outside like
they have it together and what you don't realize is it takes a lot of practice to
to keep it all in it takes so that takes a lot of practice and a lot of hard work
to look like you have it all together and look like
thing is a hundred percent a ok and you have a perfect life and you have a
perfect family and you know every day you get up there is a theme song playing
when you brush your teeth you know birds fly out of the window to help you get
dressed you know it is not like that
nine times out of ten people ask you how you doing they really don't want to hear
i'm really doing because just like a courtesy thing um so I have gone through
quite a few pretty traumatizing periods in my life where I kind of just glossed
over it never really dealt with it and the beginning of this year it was like
oh I don't know my brain was like girl we can do this no more on or what but
something just popped my little perfect bubble of you know this is this is who I
am on the outside and nobody's gonna know how dark and deep it is on the
inside just finished and you know I just thank God for my husband and I think
offer my family and I think often people friends and and and and like coworkers
and teachers and stuff that really surrounded this family and helped us get
through it so now that I'm on the other side I can see how depressed it
depressed I was how serious it was
and now that I'm on the other side and I hear stories about people committing
suicide before I used to be like well that's you know that's the coward's way
out
why would you do that you know why would you kill yourself that's stupid but now
that I'm on the other side of it i am a lot more understanding and I realized
that depression is a very
crippling thing and for those people who feel like that I mean it just makes you
feel like you're so long and nobody cares gonna be so bad so much better if
you were around which is a complete lie on the one thing that just resonates
with me is that in my life I have gone through so many seasons where there are
ups and downs bad things good things so many chapters if I decided to do in my
book in the middle of my story I would never find out how it is with my happy
ending
um so that's what i have been going through and that's why it was so hard
for me to make a video because i'm going to be talking about to step out some
shampoos and wig reviews if I could even I mean I honestly I could not get in
front of his camera and make a video I couldn't do it
it was like it was like I was paralyzed so yeah so I don't even also probably
won't even upload this loosen this is not how i turn out but he got better
thank you Jesus and I'm not where I was
it's like and now i can see how bad it was because over here is rainbows light
over there like dark clouds and gloomy arm but I am getting better day by david
by bit I had amazing summer I took a break from everything and I just
concentrated on being the best mom
I could be not caring about you no reviews or sponsors are all its don't
just let me just go and live my life and I know on some people are gonna be like
don't put your business all out there cares it's a therapeutic i started you
to as a way to talk about beauty and hair and makeup and all that stuff and
be completely surrounded with my peers who cared about the same thing you know
so that was kind of like therapy because you know how it is you watch youtube
videos and you go and talk to somebody about bagging and max hydration that
look you like you crazy
so this is my therapy this is my chance to connect with all you wonderful people
out there and that's what i'm doing and it is hard . to freaking do it but I'm
doing it
um so yeah already a special shout-out two divas wigs
thank you so much d was waiting for being so patient with me
thank you our usual for being patient because i totally thought I was ready to
do reviews and I got some products and they have been sitting on the shelf
because i just could not make a video so thank you so much
ok ok
and one more thing before I go
depression is really kind of a silent thing and unless somebody is really
truthful and honest and once helped and they might not say anything to you or
they may not seem like anything's wrong but you know take the time to ask those
people that are around you in your life how are you doing
and mean it and you know don't let people skate by with I'm fine when you
know we're not you know and if you are in the midst of depression just know
that it gets better and it doesn't have to end your chapter doesn't have to so
keep on keep on never give up
we're good
yeah
are you making a video fish
you look great Yeah right here hey up
thank you well I look right here we do this no do it
she's oh my god this smells wonderful and here
