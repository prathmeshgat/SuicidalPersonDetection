hey everyone it's amy i wanted to share with you my history of depression barn
and all that so that you can understand why need to channel know what I've been
through know how I can relate to you and whatnot this is going to be every detail
but it's just a basic background so I'm just going to get started I was always
pretty self conscious of myself and fourth and fifth grade Kara's
contribution a lot of crazy air knows pretty much the only people and like
that that great so I was getting very self-conscious and then sixth grade a
little bit better about myself but still kind of the same issues and i was sad
for days and I used to be but I wasn't quite my step
just look for seventh grade I started self-harming not that often sold it and
then in seventh grade I got really depressed I always felt alone and felt
like killing myself all the time that was always thought going through my head
and start cutting a lot more frequently and my friends and I became friends with
this girl she caused a lot of problems for us and
that you're so much harder for probably all of us and and then I tried not to
associate myself anymore thing with everybody but then she started hanging
out with my older sister is five years older than us so that was really hurtful
and frustrating and stressful collision on her out of my life but she's still
telling lies about me to my older sister and stuff so I just couldn't get away
from her and not made it so much harder and then it sounds great i also would
always have conscious about my body so I would skip some days eating I always
felt really going to 128 and not continue on into 8th grade screen is
very similar to the seventh grade except the problem worse there's less than
happy moments and not great there's pretty much nothing I always have time
to a lot I telling myself that but the greatest rd boyfriend which he was very
helpful through everything beginning of 93 was the same way I position depressed
and you started counseling and a anxiety and depression medication which didn't
that didn't help for me let there be helped a lot
I had a great counselor she was awesome she really seemed to care about me and
my problems which I was kind of worried about going into counseling because I
feel like you're being paid to listen to any problems so that they would really
care so that was helpful I still felt really depressed and
in October migraine i tried to kill myself and that was very terrible
experience and yeah it's just awful and not the only person you about it besides
like my parents and family was my boyfriend and then eventually told my
best friend i was getting questions about it because I something text that
just said goodbye so I told her and she said something in between that made me
feel better
eventually the matter was questioning you about it just exercise getting up
and talk to me for several sexual and going to be at school so that was pretty
cool and then i also told the two friends later on asking about it and
they didn't really seem to care all on the reason we do it didn't make me feel
great i wasn't looking for sympathy reading things but I
really expecting that kind of response either that was lucky and then I always
hated school so i finally started going to go online little unhappy and green
which really helped because i wasn't going to place that
hey every day I could sleep better I could have my little like mental health
breaks throughout the day school I can't even get freaked when I really needed
one it really think it changed off and we're not going to school because I just
better here so and then it wasn't a great
from then on I still felt the same sometimes but I'm since then it has
gotten from ninth grade 2 now which one in 11th grade i've gotten better i've
gone almost
without finding I don't feel really depressed anyone don't feel guilty about
eating I don't feel very bad about myself so yeah that was just a very
basic background tonight detail anything but to share with you and this is why I
made this channel because i wanted to do ha because I tell that many to that I
could do and instead of yourself i'm reading and whatnot and also help other
people because during my several years of severe depression i had a long night
felt very alone
just awful and talk to you in this so depressed and I don't want anyone old
step particularly died in I want you to have somebody that you can talk to you
can always always always continue i love you will come to me only to learn stuff
with a problem because I prefer for anyone to ask for help and to hurt
themselves and I want anyone to feel alone because I know it seems they get
more involved anyway the problems that they're gonna care help you understand
and I can mostly understand what was going through and be here to help you
some never be afraid to message me on tumblr or YouTube in a there to help you
present the main reasons desertions because I want to help everyone and I
don't want them to feel like I did channel is to help you and also to put
up just some fun happy videos are probably coming students is going to
your place of help and reminders that there are even things in the world i
hope that next time you need to talk to you come to me instead of putting
yourself and all of you and makes video I
