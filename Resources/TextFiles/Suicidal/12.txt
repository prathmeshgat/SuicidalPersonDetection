this is a story I have been very Houston's talk about me in the because I
wanted to have a guess
a happy ending don't exactly have a happy ending we definitely a better
ending than the beginning
I just got a lot of comments and messages asking about how to deal with
suicidal thoughts and things like that
I have ever been in that position and like many adolescents yes I have been
there
and no it was not just something that I dealt with when I was
a pre-teen or young and my team that was something
that wanted me later on in life to so I was depressed
on an off it came in cycles from that point on age 13
up until I was 19 years old tonight also stylized to celebrate dad's I have
written notes before
but when I was 19 it was something that's seriously
hit me and the main thing that brought that on was I got in an argument with my
closest friends he was a cruel he wasn't mean or anything it was just
I need him for something and he was continuously not
there so that hurt me a lot and it threw me off a lot
at this point it was my first when your college I did not have any friends I was
no longer and high school with people around me that I was from their web even
if I didn't like them so much
so-called does pretty much alone in my senior year of high school I was doing
this program where we work to counseling environment I don't have that anymore
knows
a hard thing to adjust to after doing that for an entire year and then some
so I was very alone I walked around campus alone at lunch along
I came home and I was alone and now that I wasn't speaking to my friend all his
friends were not speaking to me there
ila prison at this point was my boyfriend he when he was getting a
little nervous about how dependent as the coming because
I didn't really have anybody else so everything was put on him is very very
stressful
I've contacted another friends because they're going back to my high school
I feel this person listen I'm feeling super suicidal and depressed can you
please contact this teacher
because I trust them and they know what's going on and I just want some
advice
and see if they've never for or something she did not say a word it to
that Professor
about that and when I asked the person she says she forgot
and literally reached out saying please can you get this process mean this is a
matter
love life or death for me and I really need someone to talk to
and it was not important enough to them so that can easily make a person feel
super were close and that is an understatement
love what I felt soon after it was winter break I have a month off from
college
and I was feeling very a very down on myself because I had no friends I know I
tell my boyfriend worked and
there was nothing else for me to do at the same time my home situation was not
cooperating with me either
I've moments margin not at all certain people in my family
asking it very hectic and it was very hard for me to deal with emotionally
because I had
all my own things going on so knowing how I felt and that I was visibly upset
and cry myself to sleep at all the stuff nobody cared
at this point every night at the ready on time by reading about how I had my
cell
I wanted to die and I hope something what just happened to kill me
and how I wish that my mom could have lived in I could have died because
there's no point for me to live
house literally at plants any I went back to my high school over this break
and I spoke with the council's their
personal work let's just get recommending a professional it was just
a matter finally working with someone figuring out what it is that's really
upsetting me oh my oh so dependent on other people at this point it was big
downward spiral and I was in contact with other people that I did the whole
peer group thing left her name was dead
and she went out to lunch with Amy just talk about things that made me feel a
lot better
things are not really get better my boyfriend went away to Florida for about
a week
when he came back I was sort of a rat so he came over and just
was talking about things ended Saturday isn't even the best word to describe how
I was speaking because
it was literally in human it was not something I can't even describe
I who look him straight in facing said I'm gonna kill myself
and I wanna do this this not it just happened everything's we better trust me
is all the better
I'm tell you now because they don't want you to be upset I wasn't even speaking
someone else is just speaking for me
and i'm saying is words but on the inside and saying I wish someone could
just save me
I wish that somebody else could fix this for me because I'm at the point where I
don't care anymore
and it was really just a feeling of nothingness I felt there was nothing to
live for
there was nothing worth doing anything for honestly thinking that there's
nothing to live for and there is no hope for me at all
when I speak like this my boyfriend he started hysterical crying
and he was just so hurt by that giving up and giving up on school giving up and
everything just aren't always
because I was that upset any is this example that I'll never forget
and it was just the most random thing he said look up in the sky
you see these planes you realize people created machines that fly in the air
people have the potential to do that basically the point he got out with the
whole plane thing was that you have the potential to do
anything you can do whatever you want and
if I kill myself I would not know anything about that I would have no idea
about a potential I have my own contributions I have my own things that
I can't do for other people
I just haven't found it yet as His Highness just weeping and saying like
are you getting this you understand where I'm going with this is making you
change your mind at all
I just stared blankly and I said no not really just like that
watching someone you care more than anything cry hysterically pouring her
heart out to you
United say is not the second ices I'll cry in front of me I just wanna love and
care for them and make them stop
but I wasn't in that position I was the player I just did not care
about anything so versus cool comes at the end of January I see someone and as
they miss
Eric and he honestly did help me so much
and realizing things about myself and making the first few steps and helping
me
realize I am worth it I'm worth the money to go to a therapist I'm worth
living in walking and breathing I'm worth all of that it's not something
that I should just throw away because I have a reason and I have
a purpose for being here I left the little little glimmer of hope
and here comes the fun part of the story are certain feeling really bad because
the friends who I was no longer speaking what happened to be in the classes
that just started for the new semester I left the class crying because I saw them
laughing and having fun when they were leaving and I was leaving in two years
because it helps that I was
I 10 my time for that night I wrote something along the lines of I wanna
kiss the ground
all the things that are jumping in front of the e train finally someone saw that
and that person that was
dead but the person that was in the peer group with me in high school
it was we can I was very upset actually finished watching it's kind of a funny
story about the
kiddo suicidal a hospital and that experience a saying in being admitted it
did not think that that would be my future
and a few hours a group my friends from high school even people that I wasn't
really close with wind up getting together
on a chat room and death but made sure that she I'm address
and make sure that help was sent sort out one in the morning and
February I received a knock at the door and ironing new
what the deal was and I open the door and I said you're here for me
and outside there was an ambulance there are about 20 cop cars a fire truck
all this stuff and they wound up taking me I spent all night in the hospital I
was evaluated I saw psychiatrists for the first time I saw
actual andy is and people who could diagnose me and I was officially
diagnosed with depression
now the next step was a matter of if I wanted to be admitted and be a part of
the mental health program there
and i outed out of it they saw me as someone who
was not going to hurt myself I don't think I was getting do it myself
and I think they knew that so they felt all right setting the whole
but make sure that I was finally put into an official place for therapy
I was actually for psychotic as I mentioned before I was not
acting much better I was like I left the hospital feeling like
everything was so much better at it than it wasn't like that at all I still felt
just as bad it was at this point I boyfriend felt it would be a good idea
that we didn't speak to each other
because I was not focusing on myself and the only person I was living for
was and the misconception with relationships is that many developers to
save you with fixing all that but after this experience Thomas Tommy that you're
not supposed to go into relationships looking for that you're supposed to love
yourself and not you know that there's a reason that somehow should love you
and that you're cool enough so now should love you and that you have the
potential to be great with someone else just the point that you can't go into
relationship looking to please the other person completely you need to have some
sort of confidence in yourself and independence to be able to maintain
something with someone else and I did not have that so time is being the actor
that he is not only a good idea to pretend to be a total
asshole I was told I said you know what I need to hang out with people I need to
start doing things I'm gonna invest my time
in school work and I'm gonna invest my time to having a lot so fine that when
I'm not doing that also wound up at the end of the semester
getting straight-a is because I was motivated by this whole yes true
everyone on that show it but I can see it and he eventually real to me that it
was all just
a plot to help me get in touch with myself and
the things I like and the things I wanted to do and it was something I
never really had before
all these realizations are pouring in at the same time
I left the counselor at schools and letting somebody in private practice
yes if everything's perfect so much as a proof that it's really
crazy I'll give you a good example how it's not perfect I relapsed and
hadn't won day where I really felt suicidal again for the first time that
was in October
I am so aware that I'm gonna be a happy and I'm aware that it's probable that
i'm gonna be depressed again
the best thing that I could do is find things that make me feel content
already been happy and just work with it and understand this may not last for
ever and I'm not entitled to anything I'm not supposed to have this perfect
life for anything
I'm never gonna be happy all the time that is impossible
thing to want it also happened at the same time the hurricane sandy happen and
I was something that really opened my eyes because I saw all these other
people don't do something so horrible
and understanding that things could be so much worse than I had it and things
could he a million times worse
I am not have a tendency that I've been the happiest person ever sent I've had
my ups and downs but I'm very aware my emotions I'm aware that this one thing
is going to pass
and it's not cover my entire life and also found things that make you feel
about the law which is something I've never felt before
and I found a program that I really love and that people hate you I love you all
a little something that I never
thought that was ever have in a million years a year ago
I would not be able to handle things that are going on now I'm just so
grateful for the strength of gained and just the insects myself
and all the things I've learned in everything it's not something you can
get from a book or anything it's just
experience and how you gonna turn those experiences into something good
i'm happy in some senses but I like to think that I'm getting there
I'm not going backwards anymore saying that I'm gonna kill myself
I don't want to I think that there are so many cool things that I can do and so
many things and get experience that i shouldn of myself and miss at other
things
I move able to do things so why not take advantage of that now
it really just tells you that things do pass and that nothing lasts forever so
when you feel like you're in a situation that is the last for ever and you really
stop it for after
do not stick with that mindset because it will pass
it's not gonna last forever it does get better and I truly mean that
I living proof %uh that this is ridiculously long video I can't believe
that any view even stuck around to watch the whole thing that puts
thank you for watching and I will see you next video
