hey guys so I have some news after my last video i was planning suicide and as
you guys know I've been planning suicide for a long time now and on Christmas i
attempted suicide and I just got out of miller dwan it's kind of like a mental
facility to keep you safe on Christmas i was at my friend's house and we're
talking and we're drinking and after that we both went to bed and I slept in
the basement and I've been making a video for a long time now and it's maybe
an hour and a half long and I couldn't take it anymore and i started writing
writing letters as well to a lot of my friends and family but I never got to
the family because their letters would be longer than the letters to my friends
and I never got them but on christmas day it was nighttime maybe midnight or
1am and I couldn't take it anymore it's really depressed and I just really
really really wanted to go so I never finished it so i ended up making a video
saying goodbye and i wrote one little letter saying that I'm sorry because my
friend would find me dead in the morning
um I took a meat knife and I cut my legs and my arms my forearms and my stomach I
have some cuts right here and then I put a alarm clock cord around my neck and I
was going to hang myself but as i said i was drinking and I think that's what
saved my life was too drunk to hang myself but I attempted it and I passed
out while I took the court offers and I passed out from the bleeding but I was
sort of still awake and so I stumbled my way upstairs to my friends room and um
he was dead asleep easily heavy sleeper and I ended up knocking over a dresser
with my feet my legs
well I was on the ground bleeding out and that will come up and he was he was
panicky don't know what to do and here's your screaming and he can he hesitated
he didn't know whether or not to pick me up in the darker turn off the lights
took a few seconds to actually turn on the lights and then when he turned on
the lights he saw me there's blood everywhere in my arms
and he said he was drinking too and you didn't know what to do he wasn't drunk
drunk but he was drinking so i could tell you just hesitated to stay sober to
get me to the hospital and then we drove there and on the way there i open my the
card over the passenger door and I attempted to jump out and had to pull me
back in i think i was just really pissed off that didn't work the first time when
i tried committing suicide because i was too drunk i contain myself and then we
got to the hospital and they had to do a cat-scan they had to check my neck
because there's a huge line going around it and i'll show you the picture right
now that is my neck right there after the four clock hoard was it was wrapped
twice around my neck and I want to go hang myself with it but never worked and
i will show you the cuts right now and if you don't like seeing cuts don't look
but here the cuts this is what happened that night when i did that and these are
just a few hours after so they were pretty deep somewhere deeper than others
but most of them were just scratches because i couldn't find a razor so i
used to meet knife and I don't know if it's dollar not but it was pretty sharp
I think it was just because I was drunk then I can go really deep and on the way
to the hospital the ER my or I called my mom and I was crying and screaming and I
call my brother as well and they all met me at the hospital but only my mom can
come back for some reason so they just drop me off and told me that they loved
me and then they went home
just wait what and see what would happen so I was in the ER for if you are ours
because we were waiting for a spot in millard upon the place I was talking
about where they keep people safe and I was on a 72-hour hold and wait for spot
so I was not PR for a few hours until i was wheeled over there
and I spent five days there because on a weekend weekends don't count as a 72
hour hold and my friends came and visited for a little bit and we went
over what would happen after this and now i'm in iop which is intensive
outpatient therapy and it's maybe three times a week for three hours a day and i
have to be in there for maybe three to six weeks we don't know yet and yeah
that's pretty much what happened and being in that mental health hospital I
was kind of going insane actually it's kind of ironic that place was actually
making me go cycle but i want a lot of things and there are a few people that
were dealing with depression as well but when i compare myself to them and I know
any other video I told you not to compare yourself with others but with
this compare myself with other people made me feel like mice problem so small
compared to others and it made me happy in a way but at the same time sad
because I feel bad for them so I was glad that I went to the mental health
hospital to see different perspectives and now hopefully after this I Opie i
will be going to monthly or weekly sessions of therapy with this
christian-based place but after i attempted my life I traumatized a lot of
my friends and my family especially my mom and doing that makes me feel it
would help with my pain and that it doesn't matter what others think it's
what you feel is still even my feelings pass on to other people and I don't
haven't real really realize that until actually attempted suicide so I'm kind
of glad that I didn't weigh about the same time I really hurt my family now I
have marks all my arms and my legs and I'm kind of ashamed being out in public
people are going to see these and i'm not i'm not ashamed at the same time
because you know this is my story I mean this is what I went through at the same
time I don't want people thinking that I'm some depressed girl that was faking
her smile every day besides that I don't want to go into details and everything
that
