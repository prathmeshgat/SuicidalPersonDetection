growing up is scary i think about it pretty much every single day I'm always
wondering what am I going to do
where will I be in Hawaii and honestly sucks so so freaking much i really hate
the fear the overwhelmed s the scared feeling that I always get whenever I
think about growing up I always hate that feeling of being scared and
stressed and overwhelmed and just done with life but maybe I need to stop
thinking of it as such an overwhelming negative scary thing
maybe I should start thinking of that as a new chapter in my life a new adventure
something I will go through and i will make it through
I've realized growing up maybe isn't such a scary thing maybe growing up is
actually somewhat exciting maybe I should try remembering that I made it
this far
what is going to stop me from making it farther
I never thought I would make it this far I still feel a lot of stress and i'm
still super super scared for the future but maybe I should try to remember that
made it this far
one stop me from taking part in life lifes away
you just need to write it out and we'll make it through the tough times
I always try to remind myself to look for the future and off for the past
after all only kids for so long
alright guys well i hope this video helped you on pretty much i was thinking
at like 5am hey I'm always scared about the feature money freaking living having
to do work and you know just growing up in general like life it's not easy it's
terrifying it's really really scary honestly so i actually wrote down all my
life laptop what I was gonna say on this video and never actually done that

really liked it actually was really fun so I really hope this video helped you
guys a lot and I really hope it helps me a lot too because I'm gonna be watching
it whenever I feel like really stressed about growing up and I'm going to force
myself to watch it and try to cheer out and remember hey I've made it this far I
can make it farther life shouldn't give up i got this
I feel like a lot of the times i forget that I've gone through so much i made
through so much and I need to remember that i could just make it through even
more like there's nothing that stopping me from achieving my goals in life or
making it through wear whatever I've been through and you might be thinking
