hi guys it's chrissy today I would like to speak about my suicide attempt and my
state and I psychiatric hospital before i start i have some life updates that no
one cares about um i haven't uploaded and about a week because my computer's
battery was like no I can't hold anymore charge you need to replace your battery
and I didn't have any time to go to any store to get a new battery and then my
dad was trying to fix it and he was like let me just log onto your computer and
then he logs onto it and my battery's fine and no replace your battery thing
like went away so now i can upload videos
yeah but my hair keeps changing and like every single video i do so right now
it's like purple on the top and like I had baby pink under and now it's like
fading it to like a green color
I don't know how that works but science so so onto the video i just want to
preface this and say that this might be a trigger warning for some people like
this might be cheering for some people so if you are easily triggered i
wouldn't recommend watching us
um I mean it's not i don't think it i can pick up people are different
I don't know what your triggers are so I mean he might be one of my friends that
dress watches my videos because you want to give me hope
but yeah so if you are actually here and you like google this room
you know look it up on youtube or in the morning and you actually want to know
about my suicide attempt and my stay and a psychiatric hospital here is my story
this was April 24th 2013 and I was in seventh grade and my dad he would wake
me up for school and then leave to go to work and my mom would sleep in really
late so she was asleep whenever this was happening and my older sister had a
surgery on her tailbone so she was sleeping on our couch because she
couldn't see sleep comfortably in her bed so she was on our couch and in our
apartment but we're living in an apartment of time and then our apartment
like the kitchen and living room what connected there was no girl like wall or
anything like and my younger sister was an elementary school so she woke up at a
later time and I was waking up at $TIME but my dad wakes me up and then he goes
to work and I don't know what came over me but I was just like I'm gonna do this
I had been thinking about this for like a really really long time and I just
have like a lot of anxiety i didn't have to deal with and everything my life was
just like really like hard on me at this point in my life
oh I didn't really know how to deal with life and I really really wanted to kill
myself I hated everything about me I hated my anxiety i hated how i would get
on the bus and I felt like everything was closing in on me and I felt like
everyone was looking at me and making fun of me and
I couldn't even go into public without having like major major anxiety and
sometimes i would actually have anxiety attacks in public and that really sucked
i go into my kitchen and I get like a bunch of like different medication for
my mom's medicine cabinet and you know i'm not looking at the label that is on
the medication i am just grabbing whatever I thought would work so i go to
my room and have like water and a bunch of medication and i'm close my door I'm
just sitting in my room and i'm just sitting there and all of a sudden like I
don't remember I don't remember anything I don't remember hearing my door open
I don't remember hearing my family's voices I don't remember really anything
but all of a sudden I was sitting on my bed and I heard a guys voice and I was
like oh also i was texting my friends I was taking my two really good friends
and they told my counselor at school what i was doing so I hear a male voice
in my house and i'm like that could be my dad
I what I don't want my dad would come back home I go into my living room and
there is a cop seeking to my mom and my older sister who are both sitting on our
couch and he's like where were you I was in my room
and then he goes on to his little radio and he's like she's here and literally
literally like 15 to 20 tops come into my house I think cops get paid if
they're bored and just take on like different new assignments or something
out alone but they're like literally 20 cops in my living room and kitchen and
they were all where were you we were looking for you later i found out that
they were all they all had come in and we're looking for me and they thought
that I went to a friend's house or I was hiding or something and they were all
looking for me but they didn't look in my room for me which made no sense to me
i don't know why they didn't look in my room for me
all the cops are pretty chill 241 he was like a really big douchebag
I don't remember anything they really said i don't remember what the douchebag
said but I remember being like wow he's a douchebag and all my family agrees
with me he was a douche bag so he was a douchebag
look um no okay let's go get an ambulance so I go outside with them and
there's an ambulance so they put me into the ambulance and the last thing I
remember was my dad at the end of the ambulance and he told me he said I'll
meet you at the hospital and after that I don't remember anything later I found
out that I was transferred to like three different hospitals and my heart was
failing and my parents were really worried about me and stuff because like
the doctor's literally thought I was dying and stuff but i don't buy anything
and i woke up on a Saturday so I was like unconscious for like three days I
don't remember anything from the last three days and I just wake up and I feel
like my nose is running so I go to like wipe it and all of a sudden I feel like
plastic going and gets plastic and I look at my finger and I have one of
those like pulse things that you like put on your finger
I i had one of those things that they like put on your finger to like check
your pulse and I had an oxygen tube and my nose like hazel grace and i had these
things like touching my calves and it felt good but also really weird it was
like a really we're confusing sensation and layout down and they are like these
things all my calves that like massage them so i don't get any blood clots and
I had them on my legs the whole time I was like asleep and i have a diaper on
and the catheter inside of me and my mom told me that male doctors put all that
on me
yeah
and my mom and dad they were there like whenever I woke up and I look over at
them and like Oh sweetie you're awake and stuff and my own hands me this
stuffed animal bear that i still have my room right now but i still have it and
it means so much to me i love him his name is Potsie and my mom she told me
that I like threw up so I didn't have to get my stomach pumped and I wouldn't
wake up like my mom she tried tickling me i'm very ticklish it she said that I
wouldn't wake up or even move whatever she would tickle me and I was like
fighting the doctors and I was like kicking them I was like really violent
and I don't remember any of that and I'd have a nurse with me 24 hours so I like
a day nurse in the nighttime nurse and this nurse she's like hey do you want to
brush your teeth and I'm like okay yeah and she goes to put the mint toothpaste
in your mouth with a toothbrush and then I realized my mouth is as dry as the
Sahara Desert and that shit tasted fucking next e but the doctors just look
become in and they're like we can let you move to the psychiatric level of the
hospital if you can pee on your own so I like those bathrooms are piano like okay
we can move you so I get moved to the psychiatric section of like the hospital
and
after that I was like in and out of sleeping for like the next three days
and I mean there's nothing really else to tell you about my stay at that house
at all because nothing really happened except i was there for two weeks because
the psychiatric hospital like the own like the hospital that's only
specifically for psychiatric was closed because they had a disease or something
get like under the carpet and they have to like we do everything so that's
psychiatric hospital they got moved to like their own little section of like
the childrens hospital i was at and they didn't have any spots opening up so I
couldn't like go there
well i have to have a doctor with me 24 hours like a nurse so they can check my
my vital signs i think that's what they're called though I had a daytime
doctor and he was the only one I really that really like stuck with me because
he was like super cool and his name was tyler and he told my mom he was like
which is like an hour to away from my house so my mom didn't know that this
day I had plans for my two friends to come see me after school and the
hospital but then my mom was like hey let's move you to the psychiatric
hospital that this doctor works at so I then start having a panic attack and I'm
like I'm literally such a crappy friend my friends can you come see me they can
they can't come see me
so all the doctors come in and they're like let's do all this paperwork to
transfer you to be a psychiatric hospital so after all that they send me
away then I get moment to the psychiatric hospital after psychiatric
hospital know all the walls are not white
no we do not all wear scrubs no it is not like that one movie with that one
guy and Zach out for netbooks and in Robert I think that's called kind of a
funny story some about a funny story but it's not it's not like that and also no
one falls in love with each other I psychiatric hospitals hmm that's why
sorry my hospital island to there were 2 beds2 room so you have a roommate with
you and we all the furniture was one in and the windows were like the old shine
and we had to wear bookshelves for our stuff and my first remain because i went
to the hospital another time but my first roommate stole my clothes and she
stole my sister's Victoria's Secret sweatpants she let me use and she
literally walked out of the hospital wearing my shirt I was like she told me
she didn't have any clothes she was only wearing scrubs so I was like nice and
like you're my same size so i can give you some clothes and then she stole them
as you also told pajama pants that had my school's name on them so I don't know
how why she did that
but I get there and they are at lunch and the area with all of the beds is
called a unit and so they were off of the unit getting much and me and my
sister she came with me
um we were just sitting down and we were in an area where there's like a mini
fridge in the corner with like cabinets & snacks and where and there were like
seating their seating or like couches but not like catches you would normally
see in a home they look like kind of like waiting room couches kinda but that
was one room and then there was like the desk the main desk and then the nurse's
station and you look to your right and that's the hallway with all the rooms so
at this hospital
you have to wear socks all the time and you can only wear your shoes going
outside and to be courtyard and you can't have shoes shoe laces so you have
to take your shoe laces out of your shoes and you have to take all the
strings out of your clothes so if you have like sweatpants or something that's
string out of them and if you have like a hoodie and string out of it so I get
there and they like signing in and I have to do like a full body check so I
like they make me take off my clothes
there's like a curtain separating me and the staff members so I'm behind the
curtain getting a dress and stuff and they're checking out my clothes and they
have to check your chopstick and they have to roll all the way up to make sure
that you don't like to group razor and
or anything so the check out my stuff and I'm good and i go into my room and I
mean that's that I mean you don't have to wear scrubs unless you don't have any
clothes with you but I have clothes with me one side of the hallway of the yr
patient rooms was a female and the other side was meal so it's like a coed
facility but you can't touch people basically that all you can't touch
people i was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital three different
times
um one was because my suicide attempt in the other two were voluntary the staff
members were really really nice and I mean they were super nice and really
they weren't mean the only I know patient there was really mean
either it was i was just my anxiety making it feel like they were all mean
the hospital I went to was only a seven-day clinic so um that means that
you stay there from likes it was short term technically but you stay there from
seven to ten days and the first time I when I was there for seven days i think
and i got discharged and I was so happy to be home can i missed I can I think
that if you are considering killing yourself or something you should talk to
your parents about being admitted into a psychiatric hospital because it helps me
a lot even though i want three times the last time
it was 2014february of $MONTH 2014 and I haven't gone since and I don't know if
you need help you should get it there's nothing wrong with wanting to get help
I think you should for sure focus on creating a strong emotional support
system was like friends and family
it honestly does get better and I know if you are going through depression and
anxiety or other mental illnesses you're just like I wanted to get better
overnight I don't want to be like this anymore something I see a lot whenever I
go to therapy groups and stuff because i'm still in therapy something I see a
lot is people only depending on their medication to help them and what I mean
by this is they don't help themselves
if you are struggling with a mental illness and you want to get better you
have to really really want to get better and you have to go to therapy and like
develop a menthol a minute all like a positive thing in your mind that helps
you to get better you can't just take medication and just hope it gets better
like that's not how it works
you really need to want to get better and it really does get better like I was
in a place where i wanted to kill myself I was self-harming so often i was doing
so many hurtful things to my body and
and now i'm very happy with where I am in life I am so positive i love my body
I'm not self-harming anymore i have so many friends and I'm just in a really
positive place in my life and i'm really glad i didn't kill myself and I know
that if you are going through similar things you really wanted to get better
overnight but it doesn't work like that but I promise you it will get better you
just have to be open to wanting it to get better and once I know that you
think that right now you are just stuck in this place and you're not going to
get better but i can tell you if you're open to wanting to get better
your mind will change so much you will change and grow as a person and you will
just you're totally different person then what your mental illness is making
you think you are you and you
I used to think I would never be so positive about wife but now i am and i'm
very thankful that i worked on myself and I know you can't do you just have to
do things for yourself like if you are going through all this you need to tell
your parents
hey bro please let me be hospitalized or please let me go to therapy and I have a
friend who is going through some things and their parents don't really
understand what mental illness is and a lot of parents are like that where they
won't let you go to therapy or they deny that you have problems if you are
struggling
stillness and your family doesn't understand you need to go to like school
go to places and find friends who are supportive of you and can understand
where you're coming from and can really help you become a little butter that is
all I really have to say if I forgot anything i will probably put like text
