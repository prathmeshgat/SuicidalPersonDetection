I remember the day is June third two thousand fourteen 
and that was the day I tried to kill myself and I'm not saying this for pity or anything like that it's it's nearing the one year since my cousin's been gone 
and I kinda wanna tell you guys about this to tell you guys like if you're going through this I've been through it I understand everything that you're going through a promise that 
everything gets better because two years ago if you Tony l'oreal be doing you too will be so happy I would never believe you I would have said that's a lie I'm never going to be happy but I'm telling you a story 
and saying that it's almost two years later and I'm here and I'm happy will kind of my mental health is always been a struggle for me I had anxiety ever since I was little 
it wasn't diagnosed till two years ago so I have 
depression social anxiety and generalized anxiety and OCD 
so I am for things which I know that's a lot jammed library 
so I remember it was the day after my dance recital and I remember it was I was kind of going through a lot that year my lips are heading downhill like I was in grade six at that point 
and I remember my life just completely going from here to down here like it was like deteriorating so fast 
I didn't wanna live I wanted to die I thought I was worthless I thought I was I was really sad at that point in my life okay sorry about that I had zero minutes 
and everything was going downhill from there and I didn't tell anybody about it guidance how anyone Hey I'm sad I don't like this I I can't talk and I'm scared all the time I'm nervous and anxious I shake 
and I didn't tell anyone about it which first always my biggest mistake if you're going through something like this 
you have to tell someone and you'll get help sooner than later like I could have gotten help way before but I just because my anxiety I was not able to tell anyone about it I was just 
here alone with my mind by myself I 
I just I I wasn't feeling well and my mom left for work and there I was with me at school that day and I remember I stay home from school and I was like I'm going to do I'm going to do it I don't wanna live I'm not worth it I I need to get out of this world 
so I overdosed on pills and lucky Lockley hi mom came home their pills I represents getting a little woozy and she called her 
yeah she got my mind obviously and she was like I remember I was freaking out because I'm so who's young pals I'm screaming at her to let me die I would say mom let me die I cannot do this anymore please don't call them please help and they don't need to come I need to die 
and it was terrible I remembered how much pain I was in Iraq the thing was kinda moving slower I was so woozy because I can feel like it like I felt like I was like on the brink 
Catholic I felt terrible 
so long story short the ambulance came and they took me to the hospital and I remember 
being there and 
if you guys don't knows they don't pump your stomach if you took something and it's not that long ago they make you drink activated charcoal so the black substance and that is why I can't drink out of late 
containers that have like a close lead with a straw it's because I get that he's a charcoal memo because they said I do you drink or putting a garden hose down your nose and putting them in your stomach 
and I drink it I you see I remember the cops when can you waters tear well and after that they took me to approach fall lips I just completely blurted 
they took me to a hospital 
a different hospitals transfer me where they have a psychiatric unit and you're so 
they took me there and they like they were talking either saying like 
they're asked me a bunch questions of course my anxiety a didn't answer I couldn't answer I was terrified to answer any questions 
I felt so bad I felt like I was worthless and felt like I should have died but I did and I was given a second chance 
and I remember going there and then they admitted me to the psych ward and I know some you're thinking like it's so creepy like everyone there is like nothing no we're not not say I promise you we're not nuts there 
but yeah so that was just such a quick short story time I spent two weeks in the hospital in the psychiatric unit 
they fixed me they gave me therapy I was okay and since then I've been back one other time to the psychiatric unit 
a year after year in June third two thousand fourteen and here 
I didn't think I would make this video I'm sorry was quick and short I just didn't wanna 
over talk about this and this is all I could get it to you guys so I'm sorry if this inside video I was you guys sometime later next week but I 
if you want him out more about this you just come down below and I'll tell you guys
