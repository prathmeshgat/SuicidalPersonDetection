here since basically june and I feel like you guys served know and that I
need to be able to tell you tell other people about it without getting
emotional
so that i know that I accepted it and that's happened in that I've gotten over
it so many of you that have actually been my channel for a while that of in
June are made on back video in and it I got a bit emotional
that's because i had gone back from mental rehab and that's really tough to
say but I was in a mental rehabilitation and that was for
I'm going to take messages that was for for depression and suicide kits for with
the middle rehabilitation was in there for eight days but for it
I i try to attempt suicide
so really hard thing to say but i have to get over it a lot of you have been on
the channel for a one-time know that I've been valid question probably a long
time to may have seen different videos i did but
so all of it started probably back in February depression up in value pressure
for most of my life and but it got serious and febrile kids that was when I
started you know something known as self-harm don't like seeing the actual
word most people call it it's called cutting and I have scars can see them it
first i started with something you would shave with and after a bit like a large
I did open up to it and that's what I was put on depression medication and
after a while the pressure medication kept me up for a bit but then I just
kind of dropped back down in instead of doing it on the arms i went to it and
use the same utensil and all that
here for a while I open up about that and stopped after after a while again
started again but i didn't use it like it
shaving razor i use natural razor from pencil sharpener
it's one of the most common ways to do it as well and that's how i did it until
up up to a week before I tried
attempted suicide
mental mental facility mental reveal rehabilitation is not as bad as it seems
at first day is probably the hardest since loads after a while most of the
people there are really nice the Diamonds girl she she was so sweet was
one of the nice tool there and she had incredible in your issues i'm just
sitting here like what what what
