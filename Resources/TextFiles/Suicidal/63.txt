he which is probably the hardest thing I will ever tried to explain in my life I
actually wrote down the bike home I'm just feel like I can help someone you
liked this like Shirley long time I felt like I was the only one who fucking does
like this the whole YouTube world people who can't fucking understand this and i
really wanna talk about my so I can remember having a horrible social
anxiety my whole life and when I talked to my mom about the shoes you were
always like like a really outgoing child but maybe it wasn't like around her when
I around people when I'm on my friends like I'm like really fucking social when
I feel like comfortable I'm really fucking social like when I'm not
everything happens like when I'm alone with a bunch of people
document everything I can happen and that's my mind goes crazy and it's way
better than they used to be but it's it's really frustrating because I don't
know why I guess what some stranger thinks of me but i do and i cant fuckin
help it in and very hard struggle I'm not a lot of things but like
I can think about me but like I wouldn't be embarrassed about anything anyway so
like I contradict myself so fucking much like man I'm contradicts itself and I
like all of my anxiety stems from the fear being alone I remember even being
three years old and my mom and I were just like scream and cry when I was
little like in there and so clean my mother in like she doesn't think I was
up and I really talk to her and she doesn't look like she didn't happen but
I would cry all day now just wanna go home I don't wanna be alone and that's
why we're friends from the fear of being on we're all trying to last year that
into my brain but then like they're not little part of you that once people
don't like you don't want people to think that like there's nothing wrong
with being very anxious and twitchy like I dearly to achieve when I'm around
people that are actually don't know like talking to Angie I get really anxious
and and like i assume not like ruins people even though like the whole is not
that I don't want somebody like you to be ruined of me like my mind contradicts
itself so much it's very frustrating like it so hard for me to talk to a new
person because it takes me awhile to the night how's that to say it'll be like it
takes me out like pine like I wish I so desperately I was one of those people
like the world class speaker the thoughts I think out loud I wish I was
one of those people that could just like bill I don't care how I would be like I
wish I could just get all of that shit out I wish I wasn't so fucking in mind
mine and why do I care what somebody thinks of me like this is me being very
angry at myself like why do I care I'm very frustrated my anxiety frustrates me
a lot because I can't feel the way I feel about it
about being social interacting I'm trying to get better but I don't know
why I care because I'm very embarrassed about things but then again like I want
them please view of me to be good I already taken place they've been
specially school but I don't know it's kinda like when someone looks at you
like one thing like always and like my whole and ninety stems from that you're
being people think of me and I think they have like a direct correlation
because he doesn't like you obviously like they don't want to they're not
going to want to be around you and like I have to constantly remind myself that
I have people that care about me in that like I'm not fucking old but that's what
comes my social anxiety and I was dying so we are social anxiety and I pretty
much like one even speak to the circus like I had to write it all down on paper
that's how bad it was in like even like talking to people like my friends like
people that were kinda mean but I still considered my friends all the time like
when my anxiety was superb at like makes me want to throw like not because I'm
disgusted because like my mind just falls back into that and I get so
anxious like I don't even like honestly care of these people think of me like
not like you get me so fucking anxious like is my money back into the headspace
and I i remember i school like I would like myself in the bathroom and I would
cry and i dont have panic attacks and was like I don't wanna like be thinking
about this gonna make me like really like back in that but like you might
even like looking at my old videos online
no i didnt say that I wanted to redo this video I wasn't real I love so I
sounded so fake and it frustrates me like like like a completely valid
message but like I don't like the way I look and i also clear that I have
uploaded like our completely valid but like I just don't like something about
me that any and it's really fluctuating it's really frustrating to be someone
I'm not to be so much better than myself and that like I care so much like Yui
shares home and making the video child and explain my mind to people out there
in like to see how people feel that they're not alone had the same social
anxiety is me so talk about with my friends and my family like I feel good
but when I'm not like I just get locked inside my hand like people I don't know
I'm so fucking answer fucking that this is the way I am this is the way I can't
help but feel the way I feel I can get super anxious around new people I can't
and it's so frustrating to me but that's the way my anxiety
anxiety comes and it comes with a lot of people a lot of human are very awkward
and I don't really know how do we will contact a few things I T like me or if
you have a lot of anxiety and I love you
