what i'm about to share with you is going to be very vulnerable and i'm not
exactly sure what's calling me to share it but I feel like I absolutely need to
and something's telling me to do it so this is a part of my story that i
haven't yet opened up about and that i really want to
yeah because I said something's calling me to do it so as most of you know and
I'm doing this in my bed for a reason
you'll understand why soon but anyways as most of you know I had serious
depression and anxiety
I actually had anxiety from my depression so you can imagine I was
fearful of myself to a point where I was like it was causing me a lot of pain and
just like anxiety
so I was super depressed and I was completely suicidal and there were so
many nights where I just wanted to cut everything off my life was great I had
everything you could want
supportive parents family loving caring good friendships on the right track i
knew what i wanted out of life
keep in mind this was five years ago five years ago I think
yeah I don't have the exact date which is good i just know that i believe it
was in October anyways so I super depressed like i said and i just wanted
to cut everything off and I'm ready and willing and I'm open tonight to share
this exactly with you so I remember that night differently
are actually not differently but exactly because i was just laying in bed just as
I am right now I i had my hair probably the same way I don't really care for my
hair much anyways as it is not like a sign
it's just something that I just never really carries usually in a ponytail
I don't wear makeup ever it bothers me to death
I rarely wear a bra and right because I don't care
and so that's in my pajamas and I just like okay like I'm really unhappy and I
don't know why I'm tired of feeling this way and I'm scared of myself and I don't
know what I'm doing anymore and this is kind of emotional for me cher didn't
expect to get emotional and I think it's because I'm putting myself back into it
but um and I just don't want to be here anymore
i'm not i don't have this this desire to live and I actually was justifying that
death was in you know like life is insignificant death made more sense to
me like I was called that and I was like all like I wasn't like that was
something that I actually wanted like I saw more value in that
then in actually living so as laying in bed just as I am now and I remember
Isaac
I really need a shower like I just need a shower is like that right
so I could get up that fast i don't think and I walk over here and I
remember feeling really weak
I just felt super weak and like what I was doing was okay and I remember I
stepped into my shower
I'm gonna do I don't know might as well just do it i'm here and i standing here
right and i had my water running and I was just letting it just pour like all
over me and I just kind of like
started bawling and I just like so done with everything and like life I was just
not happy
I mean I was happy but I wasn't happy with the fact that I had all these
thoughts and these freakin demons and these things that I had what I thought I
didn't have control over and what it was like taking over my life and like it
I felt like I wasn't in control of myself and I wanted to I was like I'm
done I'm done
life is insignificant at this point and the water was running and I remember I
just you know I just kind of put my foot right there and I just like like the
water I was like okay I'm just gonna like end it and I remember standing
underneath the faucet not like there's a few ways i can do this and I took water
like and I've never shared this because I've always been afraid that people are
going to be like that a stupid ways like okay well that's ridiculous
so I filled my hands with water and I just kinda like a few times there's kind
of like will watch the water just run through them and I was thinking about
how this could be the last thing that I was going to see and so anyways I
remembered i was like i could just you know
quickly take a breath under water I blog to the applied to the drain
it's simple now it's a simple solution and so I tried and I remember
gasping for air and I remember the way it felt to be choking on a decision and
literally like I was choking on water but that was my decision and that move
my lungs are feeling like
right and then something hit me in the back of my mind
this isn't right this isn't your time and what the hell are you doing
like you are so much more than this
you would never ever want yourself to do this from the outside looking in
this makes you you
this is part of what makes you you now let's go let's stop
so I did and then I came out and I just looked at myself in the mirror and I
just kind of looked at my eyes I just breathe and I was like what just
happened
what have I done and then I was like I'm glad that didn't happen
I'm glad that that it wasn't that easy i'm glad but it it didn't happen in an
instant like I expected it to
and then I got my shit together I got dressed and I walked out here and I just
remember like staring at my door and now it's like i need help i need to ask for
help and I walked into might as well take I did this right in here
the lights were on I remember I came over here and my i have i called my
parents and I SAT them down right there
nice out here and I leaned over
and I was embarrassed and I was confused and I told them what I did and I didn't
hear what I thought it was going to hear and you can get the help that I thought
I need it
all right like they cared for me obviously I got up and I said okay so
that's done
I came back into my room and I just kind of plot right back on my bed and I said
what's next
