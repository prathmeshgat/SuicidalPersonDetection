hey guys welcome back to my channel i could be wrong well I'm for real like 50
shades of pink right now I know why do is the fax video and you know they get
to know me time and videos but i don't think i actually attract some thing i
would be shaking I'm so nervous the whole people are gonna think I'm gonna
break down crying but instead your voice is going i'm making this video for
people out there who may have been going through what I'm going through and what
I did go through and if you can take something away from this video that you
didn't already know within my job is done and I can peacefully sleep at night
knowing that I have someone else so basically are you going to tell you my
story and how I am the person I am today and yes to sit in my legs away stop
shaking when I was about 15 are you felt something growing inside me and that's
the only way i could say that about this kind of like anger and resentment
towards actually no one and nothing and that it was a growing inside me and I
didn't really know what had to address that in a logical about it so we kind of
ignored it put on the back burner and then when I was about 16 and I used to
you know get in trouble at home alarm was a little bit cheeky potc he invite
friends and I was an innovation about that time and that kinda went tits up
and I had all these things on top of me and was being pulled in all different
directions and I didn't have to cope with that and all I i really didn't do
one day am i I just looked in the mirror and you said I hate myself i hate this
and I hate that and i hate when you do this and I hate when you do that and I
really really just displays my being and that sounds so harsh but that's Alicia
how in fact that time and I expected so far me and I'll never forget that day we
will punch a wall and people screaming people but this was my way and I didn't
really
until quite recently the impact of having me not only physically for the
rest of my life like I'm always really scares I am but mentally like it's
something that over the years I a group attached to it was like my addiction it
was something I depended on the men that I got upset and I wasn't upset that I
just crying the latest thing is that when you get so upset you sex it's like
when you're so angry that you just start crying and make your product frustration
and then that's what name do with that I will deal with it and it's something I'm
not proud of it was only one makes sense when people would see and they may call
what happened and you know i'm like like i have to excuse my feet and I became
really good at making excuses actually like and they're really good and that's
when I realized then that like I had a problem and need to be addressed friends
don't I just kind of SAT her down and I just look I have this problem and i dont
you judge me for it and she didn't judge me at all i have to say that we don't
speak anymore but then she didn't charge me tall and anything she says she still
carnate for me she was like my rock for the first like year and a half of that
happening
I don't happen once and then just came off a regular occurrence like every turn
therefore make every tree once to every two weeks every three days and and it
just got really really bad like and and my family had no idea about it I kept it
really private it's like I thought I was only me and my best friend that new and
then it was only a few months later I told my other best friend because
machine or specific there's a change in me I kept myself for last and and she
she really was like and long as that no I do to myself I know I was hurting
myself I was fully aware that i didn't realize that I was hurting other people
and it was only recently that i actually came to terms with that the effect that
it not only has affected you but has an effect on other people that you love and
the heart like I felt like really selfish for doing it but it's kinda like
when I was in that more I wasn't me i only change into different
unless the only way I can describe and hopefully that would make sense to
someone who's going to what they make
I didn't want to deal with these problems that got very defensive as well
like if someone was to see them something to my only job consider me and
I get really defensive i said i'm very defensive and anything that's like my
coping methods and her family was one thing and then if after year to it needs
your doctor tell me how I was feeling I knew exactly that was actually impressed
like home from school and go straight ahead and then we'll just see all the
time I couldn't be bothered with my friends like if i may ask me to go
somewhere I just like no I don't want to go on and make up some shit excuse just
because I didn't want to force a smile you know I didn't want to pretend the
games okay my wasn't just soften up at everything and one there was one time
actually remember and embassy here to go and I just I don't know I just had like
enough of it and I was like I wonder if anyone would ignore this if I just like
disappeared for a while
wonder what flowers we use my funeral and that is so crazy to think now
because no I'm any good space like I feel like I'm never ever gonna be a
hundred percent cured and that's something that I didn't realize what
happened and I trying to say that my closest friends and make sure you wear
like know you're only saying that now and I just get so loud because no you
don't know what I'm feeling at all you don't want us like and also door train
say that you do because you don't it's always the macro- like always and right
now you can just you know get real aggression right now if you want to and
then it's only when I think the people that are you hurting on you myself that
i stroke myself back in and make know what you're not going to do it and I
think for someone who's going through this you need to have that that boys
your head to say no just all hair is just to hate yourself and that you see
so many servings of the same offers that love all your flaws i just can't like I
can't I don't have it in me to love myself when people who tell me they love
me and how beautifully I'm late
so what I'm so weird like when people say that to me and even you guys you
come to my videos and you say oh you're so pretty i never believed it and I
still kind of don't like when people say all you're my best friend i want me to
be like your this is that like I never believed it
I'm and that wasn't because I didn't me then I just didn't believe in myself
that I was beautiful and I think myself that it was good person i hate myself
like I really date and and in six year I just got really bad before he got really
bad and I just completely excluded myself for my friends and and I put my
best friend at the time in a very awkward situation i was kinda givin me
the rest of the group and I should have done that and I don't know what I think
no it's just really hard to look back on because it could have been so much
easier if I just took a step back and you know realize what was going on and
he didn't it was just kind of like in the blink of an eye you were like at the
end of the year and i had nor friends I really only have part they didn't want
to be a doctor and only had a boyfriend like but that's pretty much what it
turned out to be hard to tell me like all these really sweet things that
always like you know why you're still I was like how can you love someone like
me and I never ever said it because it was just saw but like how could you love
someone like me how could you love a person who causes hair and they hurt
themselves just make them themselves feel better and how we run a complicated
and that the day like the climax of this whole situation i realize that no one
has to stop and teeth for Christmas
I lost a really cool zombie member and I felt was first like I couldn't cry
because that you would never see me cry i don't like I never wore my heart on my
sleeve but you know losing someone someone had such a tremendous impact on
your life i don't know i think he was kind of a wake-up call that you know you
know you might not have tomorrow and I said salty chainsaw cringe but it is
true like and I don't think i would like if I just like you know if I didn't help
the morning and has all this guilt didn't think I'd be sitting here
discussing something that was so wrong in the last like maybe one of the two of
them i felt like i was going back to that person and I really tried my best
not to but it was just a spur-of-the-moment that happened and it
didn't feel the same if that makes sense and i'm so glad I didn't because it
won't be able to see like this is not working for you anymore
this is not a coping mechanism anymore so you know I think if you're going
through this i think really should strip back to when I first started address
those problems and maybe if you can't see the person themselves look I'm sorry
when i did this years ago if that's not actually think you should accept what
happened and move on because we're all the things that happened to me I
realized that I had to because if i didn't i would just be holding this
resentment for the rest of my life and you can let you feel the waste of that
resentment if that makes sense
I decided just to the sexual happened move on you know
new day all that craft that ever since I've let that go I feel like I've let
that person go i left that part of me
Golden State don't like talking about my problems and all it only talk about
feelings i don't think that will never change
that's just that's just me that's me being nice or don't think that's going
to change i can't force myself to change the way i decided to pack and the other
aspects of how did you do it before
and it was songwriting and last week I decided you know
ok I'm holding onto so much just a songwriter and all I have a song in six
minutes and i spent like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders since every
day gets easier and a lot of people might think that that it won't and i'm
one of those people that you know where you're going to say you don't know what
you're talking about like know what does make it easier
I'm telling you know it 100% does and you know obviously that like when I look
in the mirror I see insecurities i see like i still don't like this pattern so
don't like that by me but that doesn't mean there's nothing I can't work on so
if you look in the mirror now when you say I hate this but me that doesn't mean
you're gonna hate that about you for the rest of your life you want to cause harm
to yourself that's not gonna be a lifetime sentence yeah I'm not going to
sit here and say that there's not a day that goes by when I don't think about it
because of course i do like I look down and I am I scares might see that and i
see that person but it's something that like I say have to respect and move on
from it that person that I was four years ago auction that personally was
optimal three months ago and I'm so happy to say that she is gone and she's
not coming back because she was the most sober advice in order to resentment
towards stupid things and you know no I feel way better myself I actually feel
free
that makes it like I feel like a whole new person like I can go back to be that
person
I'm going inside me anymore and of course it's okay to have your bad days I
told my family about if you want school anything they were really shocked
because I i never really show my emotions like I think there's always
been reading all morning when really wasn't it was something
more than that and I don't blame them for not knowing because I never told
them so you know if you don't want to talk to family member about it then talk
to your best friend about it like yeah that person who I talk to isn't
necessary my best friend though but at that time it definitely have to me i can
never ever express how thankful and grateful I am to have the worst pic but
in my life and like I don't have to say names I don't have to shout out because
they know who the air and what I am literally so grateful because if it
wasn't for them you know holding my hand every step of the way that I won't be
sitting here right now talking to you about how I overcame this and they
actually i'm proud to sit here and say that I have completely over Congress and
that's that's my past and yeah I'm not proud of my past but who is a hundred
percent part of the past people might think it was a really selfish thing to
do and that's perfectly fine like it when i drop this video I know it's gonna
be mixed emotions and there's gonna be a lot of people gonna be like your stupid
to do it
I know what I want agree it was so stupid to do but you know what when
you're done something its hair slicked back all just wanted to make this video
because i really want to leave it all on the table and just kind of show you who
I really am I didn't want to sit in front of camera and pretend to be
something I'm not and I want this channel to express my views and my
personality and this is part of my personality if you kind of set that but
then that's fine that's your problem not only always you my email link down below
and my social media so if you feel like you can always talk to you and you want
to just remain anonymous or something then and i'm always here
twenty-four-seven so thank you so much for watching guys
I hope this will have a positive impact on you and your views and the next time
