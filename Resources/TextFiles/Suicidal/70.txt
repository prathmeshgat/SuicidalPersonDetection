of you an awesome day actually had an awesome day today because i was able to
go to focus your zone is jacked
it's so distracting right now I do
she's just a big ball of / right now
you love me don't you all right you have to get down because i have to fill video
thank you very much I window and penny board for the first time this year I
haven't a penny board instance
Oh october i think so i've been so freaking deprived it
I ran out and i got soaked because there's a lot of possible since the snow
is melting
finally it was for fucking degrees and so that was really warm and sweating and
it was awesome so yeah but a lot of fun it was it was a good day so I hope you
guys are doing well today as well and learn how to english stated so this week
as you guys already know is advice week and I feel the number one thing that
most of you ask me about for advice for is getting bullied in my god like I can
definitely relate to this kind of grabbed and I feel like maybe I can help
you guys out a little bit because i'm so passionate about just sharing my
experiences with you in trying to help you through things that you're going to
because everyone is struggling with something
and unfortunately the majority of us deal with bullying which is I don't
understand it but it's it plays a role in our life
so this is going to be a semi-serious video or just are really completely
serious video which is very rare because I know that you guys are used to that
very much a crazy did well in me being serious it's just kind of like are you
okay so but I can't be serious person I really can
so like a lot of you I have been fully it's pretty fucking sad that so many
people can relate these days it's like the human race is about to fucking
destroy it off or something I don't know man I've just always been kind of an
outcast I'm the kid who befriended the weird kids at school because I just felt
like it relates to the more in there just easier to get along good arm over
your kid I've always been a weird kid I mean you guys know that but I really
have and I just never had a big group of friends
oh man I've been bullied since I was like a little freaky and kid I remember
in kindergarten this kid would literally chased me around with scissors like
fucking scissors
like why are you trying to cut me you were five
and I remember getting picked on so bad in the third grade that I would
literally get pushed to the ground and these kids would take me why I don't
know know how are you supposed to have a teacher wandering around at recess
making sure kids are beating the shit out of each other
yeah I don't know where the far she was it's not so bad because you just never
really stopped
I feel like became an easy target because i was like - nice or something
now you know our world is a sad place when being too nice gets you kicked in
the face but apparently that's just how it is like I'm jaded the kid who caused
harm to nobody and apparently that maybe it started like even in high school
fucking bully from the worst bully anyone is ever gonna get
kids wanted to fight me no idea why I got called so many names and showed it
at down the hall
like what the fark is everyone's problem and also i think some people are just so
sad and angry and they just don't know a way to express these feelings so they
take it out on other people like everyone is struggling with something
even bullies they're struggling in the handle in the way of hurting others
because there are some people are just straight up fucking Church
if your classified as different whether it's the way you act the way you dress
the way you style your hair
you've probably been picked on me and it's honestly so fucking stupid because
we are all different
I don't understand why some individuals think the world should be a certain way
or that people should be a certain way being different is awesome and we are
all different in that is amazing but given the fact that there's billions of
people in the world if we are all individually unique
I don't understand why anyone would want it any other way but back to this rule
think my attendance was complete shit i'm in so many classes I was pretty much
failing everything because I just dreading school and just dreading being
around these people
I was like on the verge of suicide I was so fucking depressed I was like a war to
get me out of the house and go to school in the morning
I don't know how many times my mom would scream at me to get out a bit but I just
I couldn't bring myself to do it some days I really good
I'd avoid certain hallways I'd avoid being alone for too long
and obviously my best friend wasn't at school that day it was act so I i really
know what it's like
now let me tell you the number one thing that i really wish i had done sooner was
towel if you're being bullied
tell a teacher or tell the principal I did it because I was so petrified that
telling someone would make it worse because in my mind getting these people
in trouble meant that they were going to come at me
but the best decision I ever made was telling an authority figure like it's
their job to make sure you're not bullied or that it stops and then you
actually feel safe in an environment with a bunch of fucking teenagers
so please tell someone please just also want because it will stop and let me
tell you something that I've learned after school is finished
there's a ninety-five percent chance you won't ever have to deal with these
people shit i say ninety five percent because I believe that five percent for
the day that you run into them in a fucking store and they don't say
anything because reality punch them in the fucking mouth
I haven't seen or heard from anybody who is bullied me but i have actually had a
couple of them trying to contact me wanting to be biffles and fuck that man
like they realize that I'm actually going somewhere in life in there just
stop being an asshole but listen things will change
they honestly will look at how much things have changed as you work it
that's honestly how much things are going to continue to change
you're not stuck and you will always have to do with this and whatever you do
don't take with these people say to heart
they don't know you the only things that you should take the heart or the things
your friends say in the people who love you what the fuck was i know it's easier
said than done but honestly fucking block these people out i mean it would
be so much easier if we can block people in real life like we do you want in that
but just don't pay any fucking attention please stay strong and don't take
bullying likely if someone's bothering you fucking town someone I so wish I
would have done that sooner I probably actually would have passed some classes
like I've always mention just the fact that YouTube has honestly saved me and
just being able to express myself and my people judge me i mean the internet is
shit as it is I know just people fucking come and they say craft to me but I've
sewn into it now because I've gotten it so much that sounds bad but honestly it
I don't take that shit started
if you want to be a fucking dick be a dick but it only looks bad on your part
because you aren't affecting me anymore bitch
honestly youtube has saved my life it's just it's giving me an outlet like all
these youtubers install flee when I was growing up I didn't I didn't have that
and I'm so glad that nowadays like there's so many youtubers spreading so
much positivity and the fact that we can sit here and just share our experiences
and just say hey everything is gonna be okay
and I wish I had that but for me making videos was my outlet but I'm so sorry so
many you guys are dealing with bullying in theirs
I wish that you can stop it i don't honestly feels like the human race is
she's trying to fucking destroy itself or something because why are you so mean
to each other it's like everyone hates everyone everyone's jealous of everyone
and everyone she's putting everyone down
why I don't get it like I was saying about the <day> tenth </day> if
someone's bothering you want on it honestly just block them you don't need
their negativity you don't need their shape they're just fucking trolls and
just let them go be fucking lonely like if you are someone who feels the need to
like take your pain out on other people and make them feel bad
you really need to find a healthier outlet so many things you can do and
there's so many ways to express yourself in a healthier way
- or thank you guys so much for watching I know this has been such a serious
video and I didn't really expect to do something like that I thought I can make
some kind of joke about
oh here's what some advice on how to change your socks or something like I
don't know I just I just feel like bullying
it's just a really serious topic in its it's definitely something that I've gone
through and i feel like i can give advice on because honestly you just
really you really got it just talk to someone and make it stop
you don't have to put up with it you really don't there are no bullying she's
not fucking tolerated especially when someone has to say over like when
someone has authority
it's not fucking tolerated so you may as well use that to your advantage in just
make these people stop
like I don't understand the world I don't understand why there's so much
fucking a treat but it doesn't belong in our society and I wish it wasn't here
because why can't we just all love each other and be there for each other and
support each other
