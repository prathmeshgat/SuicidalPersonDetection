ok so i just woke up and i'm about to do something that I don't do very often we
just talked very very personally about myself and i'm already super
uncomfortable and this situation on my face is not helping but this video is
about accepting your flaws even when they look like forehead dick scabs and
you might be able to tell from the title but this video isn't going to be super
funny unless I like take my ass out or something which actually might be even
sadder now that I think about it I'm like crying about my problems and then
all of a sudden I'm like a look at various you know you may have realized
that out of respect for this video's subject I sort of changed up my normal
speaking style which has been described as screaming white rapper without the
rhyming or snobby yet passionate
AP English student arguing about Shakespeare and turn this video off if
you love smiling or whatever I just wanted to make it for kind of an obvious
reason i guess and i hate saying like clich√© overused phrases so i'll say it
for my teeth to make people feel less alone and I know that other people have
made videos about this and I know that it's talked about a lot but i personally
I think that as much as it's talked about it's not talked about enough
so here we go um I am diagnosed with depression and obsessive compulsive
disorder and I take medication for both of those things and by the way if you go
through those things too and what I'm about to talk about doesn't sound
exactly like you it doesn't mean that you're not actually dealing with it
doesn't mean that I'm not actually dealing with that I just want to say
that because the one thing I really can't stand is when people with similar
issues and validate each other like that's not depression this is depression
or that's not OCD you're just saying that for attention OCD is one blank
have there been people in history that said they had depression anxiety panic
attacks for attention
I don't know probably but I'm going to let the fucking slide because I really
don't think that it's worth pointing out the small small percentage of fake or
not severe enough mental illnesses at the risk of alienating the millions and
millions of people who are dealing with those things to whatever extent and need
to be taken seriously because i personally have had people say to me oh
you don't have OCD your room is super messy and my room
is super fucking messy and not like the cute kind of messy where you go to like
a pretty girls house and she's like my rooms a mess but really just a bunch of
like sweet disregarded outfit choices i mean like trash messy like little
Debbie's rapper messy like Saltine sleeve and crumb paradise because that's
just not what LCD is to me
OCD that me is walking backwards block to touch a pole and pinching myself
really hard if I don't do it anyway I'm going off on tangents i also just
realized I'm having a little bit of trouble looking directly at the lens
because i'm still like super uncomfortable about being this personal
but i'm going to be personal
depression sucks and it hurts your body physically and the worst part about for
me personally is that every single time i get to that place every time it feels
completely and utterly permanent
no matter what the thousands time I can be laying in bed and I'm like
rationalizing and I'm like okay yeah every other time I felt better in a few
days I felt better in a few hours but this really feel I think this is it
I think this is just my new personality I think I'm just sad guy now because I'm
going through all the shit that i like it sounds boring as fuck
laughing candy boobs I don't even care i don't know if i'm going to care anymore
and I don't know how to tell myself that I will
I can tell myself right now on this video I'm sitting down right now when I
feel okay and i can tell you that a nice chuckles sounds delightful a hershey's
cookies and cream candy bar sounds amazing and Buddy boobs
I love him and I'll tell you my story about this that I don't tell a lot of
people but i guess i'm about to tell a lot of people and I feel like it's not
going to look like I'm that emotionally invested in it but i just thought about
it a lot and it's been a long time
um but when i was 13 years old
I more or less tried to kill myself it took like a bottle and a half of my
pills and I swallowed them with water and I told somebody immediately after my
family
I guess I kind of changed my mind and whether or not that makes it more of a
cry for help attempt I'm not real
sure but i still really scares me and I went to the hospital and I spent the
night there and it was hands down the worst night of my life and i remember in
the time afterwards some people found out about it and some of my friends
parents didn't want them hanging out with me anymore and I remember feeling
like a freak
I hated that I felt crazy or like I was a scary person or something and that's
my least favorite part to think about is that maybe there's somebody watching
this that feels that way that i really wish i could make you not feel like it
was your fault that you cry sometimes more than other people or you feel more
than other people are sometimes you need to go to the bathroom because you don't
think you can be in a situation that it seems like everybody else is okay with
being in because it's such it's such a fucking burden to have to deal with shit
like that because it builds up inside you and you walk around with it already
it's a lot of shit and to have people or even yourself
add on an extra layer to pile on guilt or shame
it's not fucking fair you know and if and if you have ever made somebody feel
that way think about it if you know somebody else and you've made them feel
guilt
please stop we don't need it we feel enough already
I didn't really know how to end this video but i remember that there was
somebody like a few months ago that asked me for advice on harming
themselves which is something i don't have a lot of experience in but I kind
of answered in a general way about these kind of feelings and problems and kind
of a lot of the stuff that I was just explaining so I think it kind of sums up
a lot of my thoughts on this
so I think that's how I'm going to end it with this please listen
here is what i can tell you it's not your fault
and listen I do realize that not your fault is a Triton tired phrase that may
have lost any meaning at once had and i don't mean this in the your parents are
getting divorced and I don't know what else to say to shut you up kind of way I
mean genuinely that what you are doing and going through has nothing to do with
you as a person whether it can be explained by collection of past
traumatic experiences negative things people in your life of said or done to
you or just simple brain chemistry the one thing it cannot be explained by is
you is not because you are stupid it is not because you are weak
it is not because you aren't brave enough to stop it is because you are
hurting when you feel yourself starting to get to that place try and take in
every thought as they enter your brain feel them as they come
let them happen but as they do try and question them
you'll probably find that a lot of them are not true at all
and then hopefully next time you think or feel those things again after they
have been dissected and analyzed by you they will lose some of their effect
because the more you learn about something the less powerful it becomes
kind of like a sex scene in a movie once you learn that there's some sweaty guy
named Stan holding a weird microphone on a stick right above Ben Affleck's
perfect ass
it's not as hot anymore look it won't be easy
it's not supposed to be it's not made that way it's exhausting it is unfair
it fucking sucks but it is possible that i can promise you one hundred and fifty
percent
