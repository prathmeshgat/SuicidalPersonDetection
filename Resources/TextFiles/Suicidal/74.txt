I realize that I've shared a lot of personal information with you guys like
I was thinking back on the prom night video
I seriously cannot believe that I told you guys that story together probably
see the title before you start watching this video you're probably thinking
suppose the I came to laugh
I didn't come here to think about suicide i'm going to talk about this
topic the last two years and it's long overdue time that I do so I might have
tried suicide once or twice i'm just going to put myself out there okay
rather than chopping block let's go
my mom took away my super nintendo I going to lay down in front of the front
door and hold my breath until I died
that's how I started my head should come home and open the front door and they
will be my lifeless body and I had a little suicide note next to me like you
did this
yeah I tried but I couldn't ever do it out I always start breathing i'm sure
some of you got to try that too holding your breath until you passed out
we never chose life but life is full of choices
quite an interesting parallel something real quick about my boy typhoon so he
was coming up in the do a scene was starting to compete with started to
travel i interviewed on my DOA central.com
come on the front page he was trying to make a name for himself
one night he went got all strung out on drugs apparently climb a tower jumped
off killed himself
drugs is another topic I want to talk about at some point but that's much
later on down the line
some of you guys might be thinking Suzie I'm not a suicidal person I don't have
suicidal thoughts
this video is probably not going to apply to me stay with me
one of the things I didn't know about suicides I always thought it was okay
one minute you're here next minute you're gone
I had a friend of mine become a cop in on his first day he had to respond to a
suicide
he gets the scene there was a fight between a boyfriend and girlfriend they
got to the shotgun walked outside
put the gun in his mouth and pull the trigger so he gets there and the guys
laying on the sidewalk and this is first day he has no idea what he's doing got
there about 30 or 40 minutes after they had gotten a call so he's standing over
the body making sure nobody can
around our message of tampers with them and about 10 minutes after he got there
the guy goes and starts gasping for air
about an hour after you pull the trigger
also with jumping off of high places it was killer went to high school with who
got made fun of a lot
unfortunately and it jumped off the top floor of the hospital
practically broke every bone in his body but didn't die until the next day so
it's not like how you see in the movies where you know person takes a bunch of
pills and you see the shot with a hand falls into the frame and the pills will
allow all nice and gracefully is not always as peaceful as painless is that
life is a series of choices and I made up my mind that I will be happy so if
so-and-so doesn't call or text me back
guess what i'm gonna be happy we choose to get out of bed features to be happy
which is to be angry
we choose to well whoa what do you mean
who's we choose to be angry nobody in their right mind chooses to be angry
so now you have that anger in you just choose to let it out
no I'm a very happy person it's what their face over there around them out
talking about my back and punch him in the forehead because they be trippin
let me ask you guys this have any of you ever made tea probably not what you do
is you take a little tea bag you put it in a cup and you add hot water
the team that gets made is already in that bag that guy or girl it's all up in
your business talking behind your back
they didn't make you angry just give you a situation like that a girl
the only people that have the true power to make you angry is a cell phone
provider is more specifically 18t you get that phone bill for 400 or 500
dollars and I know you've been there
that's the only exception you're okay to be mad at that point JK but seriously
you guys like stories right okay so i'll close with a story
there's this guy that I know he was head over heels in love with this one girl
this guy and this girl I was a high school thing and didn't go so well
this guy was out one night picking up his friend from work and then dropping
his friend off
dropped his friend off he found out about things between him and that girl
not going to work out and he also found out there was another guy involved
let's just say this guy didn't take it so well and after he dropped his friend
off just starting to become more and more enraged at the thought of not being
able to live without this girl so the longer he drove the less and less he
cared and it got to the point to where you started running every red light that
he came to just didn't care
speed limit is 55 dude drove like 70 or 80 all the way home
dude sped up into his driveway jumped out kicked open the door through his
keys
this kid felt so lied to so betrayed
so inadequate look at yourself in the mirror wasn't a good situation
this dude is ready to punch through a brick wall then he remembered he had a
firearm in the house
it goes to set firearm so this high school kid is not looking down the
barrel and is so enraged that he does not remember anything after that
the next thing he does remember is waking up the next morning on his
bedroom floor
so the kid wakes up and he decided you know what i'm going to do something with
my life starts going to church starts reading his Bible start spraying and
some really awesome stuff starts happening form ends up on TV
girls start emailing him from Japan from Croatia from the Netherlands from
australia from all over just love letters and something tells me that this
kid has a lot more awesome opportunities coming at him
this kid almost did something really stupid over girl
there's thousands more out there so that's what I'm saying you guys whether
it be girl problems
weatherby work problems whatever whatever the case is when you think
there's no light at the end of the tunnel
but there's no way out of your situation let me tell you you're probably wrong
I don't know you guys individual problems and struggles but I will say
this if you ever get to that low
please remember suicide is a permanent answer to a temporary problem here for a
reason
that's what I believe so get busy
