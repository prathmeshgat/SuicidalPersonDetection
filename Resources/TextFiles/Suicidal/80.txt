hey guys it's Kim rose and welcome back to my channel so today's video is
actually kinda requested by just a couple of people that message me
privately like hey can you if you have one chair one of your suicide notes and
this is something I've been kind of debating whether or not i wanted to film
or not because the day is very personal but and I was very afraid of kind of
just breaking down and crying and stuff and I hate those videos where I tried
multiple times to film it and then I just end up breaking down crying but I
did find one of them it is the less intense one that i plan on sharing today
all the other ones I they're very more intense a lot more anger and a lot more
cursing and solve this one just has a couple of curse words if I remember it
correctly and only got my teeth are so yellow oh I uh huh
I can't wait to get my braces off so I can win them but yeah and it's also the
lighting i have right now just like I'm looking and yellower than they normally
are
but ok anyway that you are not already subscribed pictures make sure to
subscribe you can click right there if you are on a computer or it will be down
below if you're in mobile device if you're not me on my Instagram or face
but I my Instagram is cameras camera and my facebook pages camrose it is an
entertainer page so I'm going to try to insert a copy of it here because when I
do read stuff off the paper i am known to kind of triple on my words and
especially trip on my words i'm doing it now because I'm already scared I'm
nervous
we're not like yeah let's do this i do trip over them a lot more than I usually
would
so I haven't typed up on my Google Docs account basically this was my first
overdose it was like I was on the computer and then I just overdosed like
I just had the urge to overdose i know you know i can't effing deuce no more i
was studying for regions on the computer and I did and then I just typing on the
computer i just typed a quick note
and i'm going to share with you guys that I so I don't think i'll get
emotional with this one because this one is like I said much of the one less
intense ER ones
this is like a two-year-old like a two-year-old shouldn't even carvings I
mean I'm sure two-year-old wood but you know what I'm saying there's no point in
pumping my stomach I'll just do it again
I just pop some tylenol advil excedrin and ritalin and more things are going
down never really up i know this is what I had to do
there's no hope I hope when you guys walk in and see me on the floor come to
wake me up in the morning
however you find me that you and the kids at school will feel as shitty as
you made me feel I can't deal with the pain of not a fighter
don't bother giving me a funeral or wake I don't want people showing up claiming
how they love me and that I was a great girl who will be missed because that's a
complete that because miss because that's complete bull right there when
it's over I know people will be celebrating maybe not three people that
I have in mind but they will get over it to be happy that they don't have to put
up with my bullshit anymore don't know paragraphs of how much you loved me
because when I was in my darkest hours you weren't there
don't call out of work to more than just to stay home and watch TV all day I'm
mad at myself for not doing the sooner I never asked to be born so don't go
blaming me or other people blame yourself for giving birth to me i don't
understand how someone who loves like I do can learn to hate their own guts and
will be and will be willing to take that color to her skin of hers when you find
the burns don't cry when you find the burns don't cry you know you wouldn't
care
I can't believe that my poor dog is going to be stuck in this house when I'm
gone it makes me sick
what makes even sicker is this letter I was an average girl in the beginning
running around outside and nothing but a diaper I try to stop myself from crying
every night I know I don't fit in my body bleeds from every cut i give myself
if someone notices i blame the cat but now they don't even find them
learn to hide them this isn't a This Is It this is it I'm surprised I even type
this you guys don't even deserve an explanation
so this I'm not crying but on the inside and always the i'm crying I'm kind of
like getting flashbacks from that day but basically that day it was March 31st
at like 430 o'clock and i eventually called one of my friends and i was like
he didn't answer something i texted him and was like can you call me he's like
why you kind of something that I was like I was overdosed and he called me
and he was like kim you need to stop this and I was like no and then
eventually he told his mom called my mom and then I was brought to the hospital
and treated and then I got sent to a psych hospital for nine days and then I
got out and I just got I was very sad that was probably one of the worst times
in my life when it came to my sadness but compared to this past year that was
probably one of the easiest times for me but one of the hardest because of my
sadness but after that my life just want even more downhill but that was not
really steines it was more out of anger and i haven't uploaded a while so I
figured I soldiers film there's see how it goes and stuff like that and I made
it through it I'm surprised but just know that honestly suicide is not the
answer and i said i know it is an every video that it's not answer and stuff and
i'm sure you guys hear that if you can see she's on many many times like
suicide is never the answer suicide is never the answer
and honestly I know it does feel like it is at the moment but from someone that
high survived those it's really not like I know your life may suck a can be
absolute hell but something I recommend is three guys to drop this on you mine
stated its semicolon i might get it tattooed on me
eventually but it's hard the semicolon project if you follow my instagram you
saw this video is not sponsored by them but honestly with the couple of days i
learned about it monday and I mean I heard about it before about and really
put a lot of research into it but now that i have like it's an awesome project
and it's just how I like the author could choose that choose to end a
sentence with the . or use a semicolon to keep going
your life is the story and you are the author something like that and it is
really good i really suggest you guys look into it i'll put a link for it down
below
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to give it
a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see our beautiful lovely people next time
