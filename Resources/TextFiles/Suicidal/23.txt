hey boys and squirrels there a corny romantic looks really pink it's really
cold outside and I have trouble getting into the garage
I'm not make grandpa's house right now it's a lot quieter here so I thought it
would be better for me to film somewhere i have more privacy and I assume that
the sound quality might be a little better here as well so the next couple
of videos are going to be really somber and tone and they're really serious
topics and if this kind of thing topics of suicide and self-harm makes you
uncomfortable
I wasn't just you not watch the next couple of videos because we're going to
be talking about my psychological issues for the next couple of videos and I
promise that it won't be the only thing we're going to talk about will get back
to happy fun bubbly Sarah eventually but I kind of had a really big experience
that I feel like I can't just I can't just go on and pretend like nothing
happened i have to tell you guys what's been going on in my life I'm not going
to have a lot of fancy edits or anything like that I know that it's not fancy but
for some reason that's youtube talk we use the word fancy edits are fancy
anyways I'm a little nervous you've probably noticed by my breathing habits
so about one week ago on the twenty-third of $MONTH december i was on
break at work my new job by the way I'm a hostess at a Japanese restaurant
called fuji in the mall in jefferson city anyways I was on a break from work
I had a two-hour break and i went to a local grocery store and I bought a
bottle of sleeping pills there are 50 milligrams each
I took 24 of them i read that that would be a lethal dose oh I took 24 sleeping
Phil's 50 milligrams each huh
I did this because I been suffering from major Reid recurring depression since i
was about 12 or 13 years old ever since i started going through puberty I
started self-harming when I was about 13 and when I was 14 I thought it would be
a miracle by the way I'm not religious by any meaning of the word i thought it
would be a miracle if i survive to the age of 20 if I didn't kill myself before
the age of 20 it would be just absolutely miraculous because i was
completely miserable i realized that i had been an existential nihilist since I
was about 13 years old and I didn't find the word for that I didn't find the
expression the until about a year ago it was just my process of thinking there's
absolutely no point and no meaning to life and that's something that's deeply
bothered me for a incredible amount of time I felt like this for about half of
my life i'm 23 now there's just a lot of meaninglessness pointlessness and it's
been really hard to tolerate the last decade has been a ongoing struggle so on
the twenty-fourth we were planning my whole family we're going to go to
Florida we were going to wake up it on the beach on Christmas and my mom's
birthday is the day after Christmas she had always wanted to be on the beach for
her birthday which is something I got to do this year which was incredible and I
feel really guilty for ruining this vacation for my family and I kind of
wish that they still would have gone without me but at the same time I'm also
really glad that they stuck around so that somebody would visit me in the
hospital so the day before we were supposed to leave for florida during my
break I took 24 sleeping pills
and i sat in my car I sort of realized there would never be a convenient time
to kill yourself no matter what it's always going to be a pain in the butt
for someone else so I kind of thought now's a good a time as any and I've been
ridiculously miserable for a decade and I just felt ready to go so i looked at
my phone as wondering how much time had passed like how long does it take to
kill yourself files kind of wondering and I looked at the time on my phone and
I realized that I had tunnel vision and everything was really really blurry and
that sort of land reality kicked in that I was really going to die so that
terrified me at that moment I realized that I didn't want to die I just didn't
want to hurt anymore because I've just been suffering psychologically for the
past decade like I've been telling you guys
mental illness is something that should be taken a lot more seriously than it is
so at that point I don't know how because I could barely see and I was
feeling somewhat delirious i called my little sister and I was like I took all
these pills and I'm really scared and I think I'm going to die so i was like i
think is probably crying at this point to and she's like it's okay calm down
i'm going to call 911 and that's what she did and she got back on the phone
with me again i'm not sure if I called her or if she called me i was walking
around the parking lot stumbling around and I was panicking and this couple in
their thirties parked right next to me and they're like are you okay do you
need help and they called 911 to and a police officers stopped by first and he
told me to sit down on the curb because i had been falling down and I have
bruises because i was just stumbling around hurting myself because I was just
panicking so badly and everything was blurry and I was like I'm going to
I am terrified so embarrassingly when the police officer was telling me to sit
down one of my my ex-boyfriends friends happened to drive by and so my ex that I
was in jail anyways that's a complete other story
I remember the police officer telling me to sit down and I don't remember
anything after that I remember waking up in the ICU they did do a cat skin and I
barely remember going into that machine i was not mentally there they were kind
of worried that I was going to be disabled
I remember hallucinating and having auditory hallucinations as well while I
was in the ICU I was laying down in the hospital bed and I thought that my cat
was in in my hospital bed with me and I was like petting the blanket and I was
like over silly you look so cute today
you've been so quiet I love you and I'm like petting the blanket my mom was
terrified I wish that I hadn't been told this because it's heartbreaking but my
grandma was so emotionally wrecked walking into the hospital that my little
sister had to help her walk into the ICU because she was just crying so badly in
the parking lot and like I feel really guilty i wish that I didn't want to hurt
anyone by doing this but I've just been hurting so badly for so long you know
but after almost dying I kind of realize that there's a lot more possibilities in
life and after being in the mental hospital for six days i also realized
that I don't know life could be worse being in the mental hospital is not fun
and this is actually
the second time I been committed and I actually when I was out of it and when I
had had all those sleeping pills i was in the ICU one of the nurses asked me if
I wanted to go to the behavior health center and I was like yes and then they
were like are you sure you sure they're asking me my address in my family
history to make sure that I knew what was kind of going on and I was like yes
commit me so technically it was a voluntary commitment but i still was not
allowed to leave until they thought that I showed signs of improvement the mental
hospital is not fun
the showers are cold and have very little water pressure hospital food is
gross and you know some of the patients make you realize that your problems
aren't so bad to be perfectly honest there's a girl there who i think has
schizophrenia who always took showers with clothes on and kept turning on the
lights in the middle of the night I am so glad that I was not her roommate she
asked me to hold her hand a lot she had some very interesting things to say but
i mean like i said earlier it makes me realize that my problems mentally are
not nearly as bad as what she has to deal with on a daily basis in the
hospital they talked about medication they my family doctor put me on
citalopram an off brand of celexa and SSRI antidepressant about a month ago
only 10 milligrams a day and my doctor at the behavioral health center said you
know this is a really low dosage this is kind of like if you were really really
hungry and your mom gave you like one chicken nugget it would make you
you you know it would just like stir up your appetite you'd be more hungry and
probably more angry to my doctor thinks that that antidepressant putting me on
that is what kind of set me over the edge
I didn't do well on that medication whatsoever so my doctor had me stop
taking citalopram and he put me on an off brand of abilify and something else
i can't seem to remember right now i'm also continuing to take my vitamin every
morning I have to take these with food otherwise I feel really nauseated and
they also make me have really flipping weird dreams like really unusual dreams
I have a family history of depression i'm sure you guys are probably wondering
why like what's wrong with you why are you depressed and that's a really common
question really all i can say is that its most likely genetic however my
experience from age 18 to 20 when I was dating a guy who is sexually and
emotionally abusing me that still haunts me almost daily and that's something
that I have trouble dealing with a lot of time other than that I have multiple
family members who have participated in self-injury cutting that sort of thing i
have a couple of scars still that I sort of realized if I had died then i would
have these ugly cuts on my arms and my ankles you know but if I'm alive now as
long as i'm alive i can still heal i can get better and I don't have to have
scars of self-injury at my funeral you know and I don't want to have those just
I can't imagine what my friends and family had to go through and really
fortunate and that my friends and family
visited me every single day and the hospital visiting hours were short but
I'm still grateful that there was never a moment like there is never a second of
visiting hours that I didn't have visitors there
my parents my little sister my friends like people were there every day and
last night my friends Sarah and West came over because yesterday I got out of
the mental hospital so Sarah and West came over last night whenever they left
they hugged me and they're like I'm so glad you're okay
that's what they told me and I'm glad I'm okay too even though i'm not happy
most of the time and even though it's tough to keep going a lot of the time
too but i'm just going to keep taking my medicine and i'm going to exercise and
i'm going to work and i'm going to just try to make the best out of what I have
if you're thinking about hurting yourself tell anyone you know like it
doesn't matter who it is and obviously they're going to try to prevent you from
doing this but you should be trying to prevent yourself from doing this too
because it's not as I don't know romantic is lots of people like to make
it out to be
death isn't something to look forward to as long as you're here it can get better
even though it doesn't seem like it and I'm just gonna try my best like I'm
gonna stop comparing myself to everyone else I sometimes get caught up in the
fact that I'm 23 and I'm just a hostess and I still haven't finished college I'm
like ashamed of myself I feel really crappy that I don't have my shit
together by now which I feel like I should in its painful that people always
are telling me you have so much potential you're so creative you're so
intelligent it's painful when people tell me this because if I am all of
these things then I should be a lot farther in life now that is
him and that really hurts
so if you can if you have any kind of insurance try to go to therapy try to
get medicine because i kind of thought to myself you know maybe I should be
hospitalized and then I was terrified it how much that would cost because i get
paid eight dollars and twenty-five cents an hour
I can't afford to be hospitalized but if I didn't get hospitalized then I would
be dead now
I mean what's worth more like a couple hundred or couple thousand dollars or
you're like your life your well-being
I know that money can be really stressful but there's nothing more
important than your mental and physical well-being now this video is almost 20
minutes now so i'm gonna go ahead and cut it off now i'm going to go ahead and
make another video just explaining my experience at the mental hospital and
i'll go ahead and put that in the description all put an annotation right
here hopefully you guys stick around for that too if you guys have any questions
or comments please feel free to leave them down in the comments i try to read
them when I can
I've been kind of distracted with my own thoughts lately though I apologize for
that
okay well i'll see you guys in the next video bye
