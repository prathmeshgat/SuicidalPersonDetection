out there these days really important to me just kind of 20 2012 I predict my
life on September 16 and right now I'm in a really good period of my life
spiritually and emotionally and mentally and I just feel like it's really
important to share my story so basically September 16 2012 is always been a day
and I will always kinda remember the time I was really depressed and suicidal
I was dealing with eating disorder I was always in our treatment centers
hospitals counseling session you know it was a really huge thing in my life the
time no way like me to life really cuz I've been doing this until 12 so that
night I was just really depressed and you know I was going through a lot and I
was like in drama of my friends because you know whenever you to prise like you
don't want to you really don't want anyone help me helping you so huge and I
really jailed by the same time i doing so you know like no one and I mean they
do care they want to help me i wanna tell teachers or counselors know but I
become the guy like a knife fight over LA and
so happy and I don't know but I'm just so fed up with my so at five o'clock and
I i mean that every 16 17 but I was in some degree 16 and so I went upstairs
and I had pills for a variety in like-for-like medical reasons too and I
always had them downstairs in the morning so I have announced their moms
like me there I was a two bottles and I went back upstairs I was thinking about
it I was looking up side effects are looking like suicide of everything about
that I was writing a letter not really like a letter was just kind of a sticky
note to post my phone for my passcode my phone because if my mom family this
morning my phone and I did not and then I had a secret Instagram I started 15
