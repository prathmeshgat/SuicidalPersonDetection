hey how's it going so i made a video in a while except been really busy with
deadlines and stuff but this is the video been wanting to make for a while
I think mental health is something that's kind of risen to the surface a
bit more in the media and stuff recently and it's something that I didn't know
anything about until I experienced it firsthand
we need to know as well this isn't something that a lot of people know
about me and it's quite a big deal for me to come out and speak about this so I
hope you appreciate it look from the videos I've made so far you see news
quite a normal person so I really wanted to reiterate the fact that mental health
and mental illness are something that can affect everyone and anyone
also when I was going through this I tried to fight videos and blogs and
stuff that people have made about the same thing that I've been three
I couldn't find anything that was a lot of stuff about depression which is great
like it's really really really good that people are talking about depression now
and it's coming out a bit more last time that wasn't necessarily the worst part
of my experience so i made this video for anyone who wants to learn a bit more
about the subject all for people who went through something similar to me
that makes me feel like no one else has been through the same thing and yeah
just generally feel better about the whole thing I really didn't know
anything about mental health until I experienced it personally
so I'm just going to tell you everything I know
for experienced mental illness I was just like everyone else like if you see
someone a bit strange on the street maybe shouting random things or doing
something a bit weird
you always just kind of single variable with I wish to avoid them
up until now I've never going to the mental process of thinking it's not that
fall like they haven't chosen to be like that i like to think of mental illness
is almost like a puppet master that completely takes control of your brain
and your body and makes you do things that you wouldn't necessarily normally
do
so if you have a comment contact with someone who has a mental illness you
have to realize that everything we're doing is not them it's not the real
person they are it's just something that's taking control of them
so you never explained that i'll just give you a kind of brief history of my
life before I was diagnosed with bipolar i actually have something extremely
traumatic happened to me when I was about 17
I mean I would like to explain it to you but father I didn't think it would be
very found people who are involved talk about it thoroughly
so I'm not going team but basically thing happened to me and it completely
changed my life it changed my whole life changed my social life but generally
just changed the way I look at the world from then on my way of dealing with it
was just too kind of bottle it up and soldier on and try and be as brave as I
could
which kind of resulted in me only ever really talking about it when I was
really drunk or just generally not sober and this was such a bad way to deal with
it because I i ended up speaking to people that I shouldn't necessarily have
opened up to
by the time the morning came like nothing was achieved have moved on
anyway
also just really pointless and stupid I only realized fairly recently that I've
actually gone through depression after i had been diagnosed with bipolar
I went through a phase of just getting home on friday night after being at
college and just staying in bed for the whole weekend watching box that some TV
and only ever getting out of bed to go to the toilet or to make myself like
mashed potato here i put it down to me being lazy and then made today that it
actually I should have realized that i was something more going on that board a
couple of days i was in college and I was doing really really badly i think i
was out foraging it like a fail
I'd also put on a bit of weight which kind of sucks I realized this when I
went into a top changing room and are trying on a bikini realize I didn't look
the same as I had like the year before and I just generally felt really really
really shit always loved it was around that time when I realized that I
couldn't let things that happened to me
bring me down and I have to make myself the best person I could be and just deal
with everything and be strong and be the best person I could be so around that
time i decided i can I need to lose weight
I need to get fit I need to sort out my grades so I started getting up at like
five every morning to go for a jog and I would work at college
all day and then on weekends I would like my socks off as a way to save up
money
university and i managed to completely turn everything around I lost lives away
really fit and well and I was way healthier than I've ever been in my
entire life
my grades up to two merits and a distinction which i think is the
equivalent
have a baby if you're doing a-levels and I turned our balance when i go into the
university that I wanted to go and I saved up like to round which was
brilliant
I was feeling really positive about any everything and just feeling amazing
generally so i went to university and i moved into holes to the very hectic
environment for any of you who haven't been to the halls or haven't been to
University yeah I moved in with two girls and two boys who are all
absolutely lovely like really really nice people
I was really enjoying my course as working me hard and I was like playing
even harder things going really well and it was all exciting and almost a bit
kind of overwhelming but it was amazing basically and I was really beginning to
feel like I and what I worked hard for ya
things are going really really really well I almost got about a CD about what
I was eating and what i was doing because I kind of had this obsession
with just being the best that I could possibly be and it kind of reminded me
of that film limitless
I i can draw that comparison so half the time I was feeling really good really
excited and positive about everything and then the other half of the time I
was feeling really anxious and I'll control and like if one tiny thing would
go wrong
would completely ruin everything for me some days my brain would be going so
fast i would get completely overwhelmed and just start crying and I like I
couldn't control their and I didn't have anyone to talk to about it
if you bring someone up crying over the same they're going to be like oh what's
the matter
and I have literally nothing to be upset about but everything that was going on
in my brain was so overwhelming
I was just crying and it it was so so weird
so kind of like kept it to myself there i was saying to my friends I was feeling
a bit weird and wasn't really feeling like myself but I just kind of brushed
under the rug
so I didn't really know anything about mental house so this one week in October
leading up to halloween i had a very stressful week i was working really
really hard
I was having my friend up to visit that weekend and I was really really obsessed
with the idea that she would have a good time I didn't want to have to go back
home and save it should have to shit time when you come to visit me in
bristol
so I made sure we have a good group of people to go out with
I made sure we have outfits to wear I just basically made sure everything was
going to be perfect and it was it was really amazing like had such a good time
together during the day and then at the night time it was amazing
actually before that I wasn't really getting much sleep during the week
because i was so actually about everything one brain just wouldn't let
me go to sleep
so with all of that and then us going out with the weekend
my brain was really really really tired but I just that easy step stool so on
the sunday night i was with a few friends and we're all just chilling out
and like watching a film and stuff and I was really excited because i thought i
was gonna feel really hungover and Robert the next day but I just didn't
feel bad at all
it was like magic I just felt so so good and so I was really excited about this i
was talking to all of my friends about it and then we got into a conversation I
can't really remember what happened but we go into this conversation and I just
suddenly had this epiphany in my brain and it was like I had suddenly found the
answer to life and everything changed in my brain
ran downstairs and got one of my sketchbooks I've been working in from
for university and i opened it up and just start madly scribbling over all of
my drawings writing this message that I just come up with in my brain and then I
just slammed the book sure
and everyone was silent
and I think one of my friends like oh that was that was a bit intense i
suddenly have this strong gut feeling that I needed to go
I needed to go and displaying my work the people would see this message and
then feel better about their lives and I was like no you can calm down like it's
okay just calm down and that was when I had my first of a panic attack and it
was the most overwhelming feeling I can feel my heart beating in my chest like
I've never felt before and everything was really loud and really visual and i
just i i i can't even explain it like it was it was the weirdest feeling and
that's when I started to think something is going wrong here like something isn't
quite right
so I stateside and I'm i went and laid in my friends bed and everyone was just
kind of like to help me to calm down everything I like to do you want to stay
on way and that night because i knew i would be okay
like I was freaking out so i stayed with one of my friends I was trying to go to
sleep the whole night but my brain just wouldn't let me and my friend just kept
trying to make me go to sleep and it wouldnt so for this high morning came
and the state of my brain was in and the lack of sleep and all started to kind of
add up and basically that night that was the beginning of my manic episode so I
didn't sleep for the entire night and I was still wide awake in the morning by
the time my friend had woken up
I was in a state of deliria the lack of sleep and the stresses at that week and
that year had all come together to form this kind of mad deluded psychotic state
that my brain was in and that was the beginning
of my nervous breakdown and I can't really remember much from that day but i
do remember that it was almost like being in a dream
it was very surreal and very strange I had this idea in my head that it was my
responsibility to save the world and i had to get my message across to everyone
and not that I was almost like this kind of chosen one whose responsibility it
was to save the world and get this message out there and I was determined
to do it
I didn't really know how and I thought that had to like follow these clues and
like do certain things and like a one point I thought that I had to like
disappear into myself and then be born again
it's really all it's all really really weird i don't really know how to explain
it because it was such a kind of surreal experience
yeah what happened after that was my friend speak to my dad on the phone in
the hallway while I was just being with in his room
handsome and my dad came to pick me up at about midday and as soon as I saw my
dad coming in the room my heart sank and I felt like there was something
seriously seriously wrong
and my dad got me in the car and started to take me home in my deleted date
I thought he was trying to kill me it was honestly the scariest moment of my
life
I can look back on it now obviously it was just my dad give me a lift somewhere
but because of the state of my brain within
I thought that he was taking me into the woods to kill me
basically and I remember just sitting in the front seat of the car and slowly
reaching down and I'm doing my seatbelt silently and pulling it across me and
getting ready literally to open the car door and jump out onto the road
after that it's a bit of a blah was taken to a hospital in my hometown
I was put there for a while but they realized that I was so far gone that I
have to be taken to a more secure ward in a bigger city because they didn't
have enough staff and I was to AC to have enough control over and see I was
taken to a more secure board my memories from
that psychology it would be very very strange and very surreal and very
diluted
I remember thinking that a couple of the people that worked there a couple of
holes and asses were two of my friends but like in the future so I thought I'd
like time travel to another time and my friends were there but they were like
older versions of themselves
so I kept calling these people like my friends names even though they were
happy to be there were so many weird with thoughts thought processes that I
went through at one point I thought that there had been an apocalypse
I thought that everyone in the world who died and the only people that had
survived were all of us in this psychiatric ward
there was a lot of stuff about death and like moving on to like a higher place
and it was all very strange because I've never
I was a really gentle of like I went to a school called Christ the King up from
what I was about 11 I've been a solid atheist and I've never ever since then
I've never really had any kind of religious thoughts or anything but as
soon as my nervous breakdown started I thought all of these weird things about
like moving on after death and life
it was all very very very strange i was put under section one and i was in the
world for a few months
it was incredibly scary for my family because they would come visit me every
so often and obviously see me not being me but being like this crazy past and
that my brain and kind of turned me in to see I was very very scary for my
family
very very scary thing for them to go through but after a while I kind of calm
down i was put on some seriously strong tranquilizers and and eventually I did
start to show signs of getting better and calm me down and I was transferred
to an open war eventually after that I was allowed to go home
and even though i was very ok comparison to how I'd been in hospital and I was
still completely Malik and I still couldn't sleep at night
I still having weird thoughts about like I just kept coming up with these with
theories about like life and people and like like I have this one theory that
I'm about like male baldness that like people who were good-looking went bald
from the front and people who use their minds a lot went bald from the back and
I was certain that this is true and there was no denying it and it was
almost like all of my logic and scientific knowledge and anything that
made any sense of completely out the window and everything I thought was true
very very weird eventually after a lot of medication and a lot of rest
I did go back to normal
and I became the way I am now the way that you see me now where if you bad
things that came out of that experience I did lose a few friends that I thought
were very close to me and I mean I do you still have friends from around that
time who have been very understanding and very supportive really lovely
watching someone go insane in front of your eyes can be a very difficult
experience for some people at I did lose a few friends because of that so after
it happened I did eventually get better moved into a new house with one old
friend and a few new ones and i started uni again and I've been doing really
well
so things do get better like even if you go through something like that
things do you still get better so just wanted to say if you're going through
something like this or if you're worried about a friend who's gone through
something like this it can get better and all you can do is give them as much
support as you can and yeah also want to savor
it's not a good idea to bottle up what you're feeling
if you need to speak to someone about it and speak to a friend or a relative or a
sibling or something
and if you don't want to bombard the people you love with with stuff like
this then try and go into a counselor or therapist or anything
try and do everything you can to prevent everything from building up and leading
something that's really bad
thank you very much for watching this video I really appreciate it and I
really hope that it helps someone out there huh
yeah thank you for watching and after you again
