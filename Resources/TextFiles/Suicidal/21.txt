hey guys me and um how do I start this
this is going to be a very somber bring video and on a warning for those of you
who are easily but I'm like trigger issues you might not want to watch this
video because i'm going to finally be addressing my ongoing struggle with
depression and how it came to a how it came to a climax at . last year
excuse me for playing around with my face in my hair
what I'm because i just got digital when i record stuff
um so I go to private school on I go to a school up in Connecticut and it's very
prestigious that's very rigorous and as much as I enjoyed their it sometimes can
be very stressful and you know living on campus sometimes can be very enjoyable
especially one you don't get along with everyone on that campus which you know
not everyone's gonna like you're not gonna like it when I get the part life
but um just something you know
I had feelings like this in the past and you know I I was never really the
happiest person ever
still not sure I have friends and I have people that I hang out with and I do
have people that I trust
but you know trusting people is hard when your person like me who has been
hurt so many times
step in the back and stuff like that but I do have a very of a very close-knit
friend group and people who I can trust and go to if I need help
alright so we're going to the point it was about one or two days after I
returned from thanksgiving break
I spent five days in Rita and I returned a few days prior to this on
so classes resumed obviously a few days before this and you know i'm i'm already
feeling like I'm like oh my god like i'm so behind like I'm not doing anything
right now i am just a mess
I'm totally I'm not even mentally there
so you can at this point I'm going through one of my faces being obsessed
I go through like musical phase of our obsessed with like a certain group for
certain genre of music a time and at this point it was not a bot and I
connected very heavily with Kurt Cobain and
you know how i connected very heavily with his lyrics and how they relate
directly to at times
depression I was deliciously depressed at the time and I didn't really know it
until until I really came to realize what was happening
I came to I mean a few months after the incident
um so one night after a terrible day
um actually flash back to earlier in the day
um I think was either be . i was sitting in English class and I automatically
like I knew it was going to have like i knew i was going to do it
I I was like this is too much
I don't want to live anymore no one would care
like this this would be too much of a strain on anyone here
you know I'm everyone just forget about it like it would it would brush across
the table
you know there would there be maybe a couple of weeks of morning and then i'll
be over it was going to be like a huge deal for anyone and i genuinely believe
that like I i was sitting in that room and the teachers talking and all I'm
thinking about is how worthless i am to life and I'm never going to be anything
when I'm older and what this that and the other thing
so
kinda short loose I was gonna kill myself
I and you know when you kill yourself normally right to know
so what do i do I open up Google Docs and start reading and no not going to go
into detail about what the note said nor i'm sorry i'm not going to post that on
YouTube either
I just basically wrote on how miserable I was like I wrote how I've never been
happy
how I faked it every day how the only reason I stayed strong was because I
genuinely thought people like me and how how I have been so wrong the whole time
keep in mind i don't still think of think this where this is just me
flashing me talking right now and how people like I generally thought people
like me and how I was wrong and then I kind of just say down
i kiii me short but short sweet but hopefully heartfelt enough you know
references to my family about how i love them you know they stay strong without
me
so fast forward to that night sitting in my dorm and I i text message a few
people and I start saying you know goodbye
this is it for me i'm done i'm giving up
it's not worth it and they're also you know why why why like you know what
happened tell me what's wrong
they're all trying to talk me out of it and like I was so set on me like there
was nobody was going to talk about it
no fun whatsoever like if the people who have shown up we'll get to that if the
people had shown up did not show up
I probably would not be here right now because i was so set on doing it like
anyway um so I'm saying goodbyes
I'm saying like you know I'm done it's over
I've had it you know it's over I'm have no friends no one like me you know i'm
i'm a reject i'm a freak you know I'm you know I'm always angry I get angry at
the most abnormal things i can't seem to control myself and I'm stupid like I i
I'm not that I'm not the best academic program not the best academic student
like I don't have the high GPA
I my GPA is actually lower than average even though i do try
so that was really getting to me at . um and yeah job this time
people who i thought i could like you know rely on to just you know slide into
the rug and not tell you more about it but you know wasn't that easy you know
they asked to see my note of course I was dumb enough to send to them and you
know i SAT there listening to nirvana and waiting and I was literally thinking
about how I was going to do it and I can't came to the conclusion that after
lights out which is at eleven o'clock i was going to wait in my bed for about 15
minutes for the dorm parent who at that time was he lived off campus so it would
only be about 10 or 15 minutes before he left after lights out he would probably
just make sure everyone was tucked in and
in their beds before he left
and what after that I was going to act like i was going in for a late shower
and sneak a belt under my towel and I was going to hang myself from the shower
head and allow someone to come and find me in the morning hanging from the
shower dead
that was what i was going to do on because i did not have any medication on
me I didn't have any alcohol i didn't have any
you know I didn't have any sleeping pills I didn't have any you know sudafed
or advil or you know like and then I'm like you know I don't have any narcotics
I don't have any of that stuff on the so that was how it was going to be done and
you know I you know I kinda at one point I like hid behind my door and I was kind
of like you know trying to find a way to wrap it around my neck so it would fit
and you know like because during study was during study hall and during study
hall the doors have to be open so I was kind of its kind of hiding behind my
door trying to like fit around my neck and see how i would do this and you know
and then like you know I got up and went to the bathroom and just kind of looked
and I didn't bring the belt with me I kind of just want to go to the bathroom
and get a drink
not gonna just ponder was ok this will hang like this
I'll make you know make it work so i went back to study studying
and i sat at my desk and a friend of mine comes into my room and he sees the
note open on my computer is like what's this
he started reading and looking for much I don't know what he found something for
walks into my room and just starts pondering what I'm looking at my
computer and it shows you what's this
and I'm like oh nothing it's nothing
and you know I said like he's like no no and I'm like dude don't take it
seriously it's fine
like I'm not going to do anything i just i wrote it because I wanted to see what
it was like to write one I'm trying to bullshit my way out so he won't take it
seriously and you know I managed to calm down and he leave since but you know
about two minute as he's actually as you walking down the hallway
the administrator on duty comes into my room with two police officers and i'm
done i'm staring the people i'm like wow what have I gotten myself into
because like I didn't actually know that someone was going to take it to the
extreme and have people come to my school
I got that was going to phone the school like mad like like maximum they were
falling school and they were going to you know have someone talk to me but you
know someone took it to the absolute maximum and actually phone the
authorities and had someone come to my school
so what had to happen was i had to go to the common with everyone
doors open I had to go to the continent everyone's probably listen conversation
- and I have to get interrogated by the police on what I you know you know how
he was feeling
what what's going on in my mind
stuff stuff that sort and you know
among the lighting one of the cops was being real hard hat hard ass and he was
kind of like talking and he was using a very stern voice and I just remember
thinking if you're trying to talk some about suicide you don't really talk like
this to them
you know I but then the other cop was trying to you know just call me down and
um . remember there was one male and one female cop and I think there might have
been a third one I don't really remember it's all kind of hobby
um but I do remember that one of them having to go search my room to see if I
didn't have any like you know alcohol or knives or a narcotics or something like
that and of course they came up with nothing because i did have nothing
obviously if I did have something else I want to come up with the belt as being
my best option on what they found was nothing that had nothing to do it with
and yeah so I'm sitting up being interrogated by cops and I I'm just
basically time you know I haven't been happy i'm not happy i'm not happy person
and they just have why and I'm like you know I don't I feel like a lot of people
here don't really like me and I'm stuck here because that's how it was to me
like last year and before I was stuck there
like I I couldn't lead there was no way i could go
I picked this place and now I'm stuck here for four years and I have made a
really shitty decision and at that point I would do anything to go back and
reverse that decision
it's kind of changed now although sometimes i do have my spots up you know
hating it
but you know that's boarding school but at this point I hated every second of it
like I I want to go home
I despise the place the moment I could go home was at the moment I
like praise Jesus or blank
I i literally like sing hallelujah on the morning i woke up when I could go
home and eventually they finally stopped questioning me and I had a way for about
10 minutes for an ambulance to show is apparently i could I was too mentally
unstable to ride a freaking cop car and I had to be treated like I was
physically injured
so what they did was they they they too good i was at this point I was like kind
of indecent because i'm in my dorm room i'm not thinking any one of major
importance is going to show up in my room so I'm basically a t-shirt and
undies
so they're like you know
go browns and close and you know
the ambulance is coming to go to the hospital so I'm like I'm literally
sitting there thinking oh crap
because this has become a huge deal like I can I I finally knew that like this
was about to be a huge deal
my parents are going to find out and that was one of the thoughts like oh my
god what are my parents going to say they're going to kill me
I end up talking to them that night
we'll get into that later so the angle is finally gets there and I at this
point I'm still stunned so I was so on what I see which is I saw a pair of
shorts and I saw a hoodie and I can choose and I went outside and as long as
I'm walking down the hall with two cops behind me and everyone is staring
all eyes I could feel them all on me as I'm being escorted out of this building
by two police officers and I'm just thinking about what they're thinking
like you know I'm thinking that you know
they're probably thinking oh my god they found something in his room or something
I'm thinking of all types of scenarios that these people are thinking about
their minds but and it got really bad and I got to the first floor like all
the all the little kids were looking at me and I had a go out and walk up the
stairs and go to the ambulance was kinda like it was coming up the walk of shame
you could you could call it that it was the walk of shame at that point you know
I'm walking up the stairs
you know and I wanted so badly but there was no saying I was fine
there's none of that way that they were buying it like you because like what
they're going to say is someone who is fine doesn't go out and write a note and
send it to people and start saying the x and this is that thing
someone is fine doesn't do that so I think that they were going to they were
about by that I was fine and then and I wasn't fine
so I get into the back of the influence and I remember I had a conversation with
the guy is like you know
rough night and I'm like yeah rough life I like and he's like and he's like men
I think we've all been there at one point and I'm like yeah you know I'm
calm I'm not a very good mood right now some kind of getting it
i'm having like a smart aleck attitude them my god i don't think you've been in
my situation and he's like trust me i was and he asked me how old I was at the
time of it was 15 and he said I said 15 and he's like we've all been i've been
15 months and
you know I think I know what you're going through little does he know that i
have particular issues that i deal with away from school which not going to get
into this video so I I'm talking to this guy and he's like you know where do you
live
clearly bored here is already left like I live in community you know I want to
live there three or four years
I think not at that point was 23 and what do you do I play tennis I saying
just that the other day and he just and like you know it's really quick he's
trying to get my mind off of it because he knows that I'm freaked out because
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you understand that these people showed up
at my door and I was completely stunned dad and I was I was like wow
cops at my door right and you know the the dorm parent was behind me
well the the the person who was the designated driver at the time which he
wasn't the person on duty in my dorm when he was the designated driver
because there's people who have like different jobs for different
what not and he was the designated driver for that night so he had the keys
in the sienna and he was in pursuit
on my way to some Hospital and meredith and so we get there and I get to change
in two
crazy people close because that's where I was staying I'm staying in eq behavior
unit so I got to hand my phone
I got to hand them my keys they patted me down to make sure I wasn't hiding
anything
and they made me change into like they let me have my shoes because like I
could seek screw yourself up with a pair of shoes
let me take my shoes off and put on socks that had like these
download , but they're like these rubber grip things that like they don't they
make it so you don't slip on the floor when you walk around and so I i kinda
just yeah so I'm sitting in my bed and I'm like those woman next to me and
sheet
you know if you think I was crazy shoes the voices the voices were talking to
her
it's almost say so
she comes in and she's phased out I can't even think about how many
different types of medication she's on she's probably on like mood stabilizers
and like sleeping pills and got out God knows where else
and so she comes in and she stands in the doorway for a second because i have
the remote to television i was watching television time and I'm because I just
been debriefed by my guidance counselor about how i'm going to be studying night
here and I also been debriefed about how i'm going to be up at seven o'clock in
the morning to talk to a psychiatrist
so I was like cool great awesome
love in life
so they asked me you know are you thirsty are you hungry i'm like not I
kind of want to be left alone
so they're like okay you wanna watch television or I'm like yeah that'd be
nice
so like you know they gave me the remote they gave me my long time they close my
door slightly and the woman comes in and she stands at the door for a second
before realizing i have the remote and I'm petrified like she's just standing
there
she's not standing here standing and she realizes that i have the remote and she
comes in and in a very somber voice she said can I have that please
and I don't even say anything I just reach out to give it to her
I was beyond words at how I had ended up in this place
so the nurse comes in and she's like have you told your parents and I'm like
I told my dad but I made it out to be a little less of an issue that it is and
she's like wall tomorrow I suggest you phone them and tell them what happened
something like to have to tell them what happened and so I did not go i go to bed
wake up a few times and I have to go to the bathroom and the people there are
basically like you can be in here like 10 minutes at a time
that's it and I'm just like cool and so I went I peed and I went back to bed the
next morning comes I have to talk to my parents and they're like why do this is
why why did you write to know why do you want to do this and I'm just like in my
head I'm like I don't know i don't know like I I didn't know but like I want to
tell them because part of it was their fault but I want to get into that so i
wake up at seven in the morning
seven sharp they bring me breakfast which is toast butter
orange juice no meal and they had eggs but my ex so i just ate the home you
know and the toast and the oranges psychiatrist comes in and guys probably
got the IQ of a goldfish you literally sits down ask me the basics and says I'm
good
like you can go on like breath
do you know I'm here do you know why I'm here
so like he releases me he signs the papers and I can go and guidance
counselor come pick me up
and it's a very nerve-racking car ride home
Barry because I don't trust this one for anything
I don't I'm sorry I'm not I'm not I'm going to be completely honest I don't
trust her
um so I'm talking to her and I'm like what's the plan now with what you need
to go back to class now he's like well there's no way you can go back to
classes because the scrutiny that's going to be placed upon you is going to
be so big it's just going to make everything more so we're gonna authorize
for you to put on medical leave
it's probably going to be good for you to go home and see a doctor to get some
medication for this and I'm like wow
why didn't I think of that and I was . I'm just like because I'm going to
pickle
I'm in a real pickle not gonna lie so on
I go back and I have to pack my stuff but it's a school day
so not only are going to be people lingering around on their free periods
of EDP
I don't know where my bag is I don't know where my backpack is my red
backpack that I need because i need to pack clothes in it so I remember leaving
in the dining hall for some weird reason so i put on the blackest cody i had put
my hood over my head and go out and search his bag on and
I eventually found it but i have to walk through the dining hall and I keep my
head down so no one knows who I am a ghost
no one no no one knew who I was no no at all like I was like no one even looked
at which was how I wanted because i don't want to be asking questions
um so guidance counselor actually shows up and we call one of the mains people
who says he picked it up so we get it
I pack my stuff and I have to sit and wait in the nurse's office because my
father cannot get a flight until a couple days after
because the wintertime flights to and from Bermuda are kind of limited in the
wintertime because not a lot of people are flying to the one time like who
wants to go to tropical paradise in the wintertime not to be honest permit is
nicer in the winter it's less hot mic input
people come here gets hot and because it's nice in the summer so flights for
your love made sure she so i have to go to my grandma's house for a few days and
my grandmother is she cares but she understands that i don't like she
understands she understands that there are certain things that people don't
want to talk about
and at this point I have to stay with her and she understands that this one of
those things like she knew she knows I know what's up but she knows they don't
want to talk about it
she knows I she knows I need her because she's my grandmother and I love my gram
of the death she wanted most amazing people on this planet like she's amazing
and she knows I need her but she knows I don't need her to be firing questions at
me that I'm not in the state of mind answer so I go stay with her and then my
dad comes to pick me up and I go home to a doctor guy runs all kinds of tests guy
determines that I have bipolar disorder
anxiety
holy shit depression
shocker and anger management disorder
another shocker that's four for that i'm playing with on
but the thing is you kind of have to choose which one is impacting most in my
opinion and anger management that's just me though
but apparently according to him it's the depression / anxiety exactly my father's
work
you may be right he's the doctor I want
by what he said so long story short he subscribes me with this medicine that
I'm still taking called lamotrigine electronic version or whatever it's some
mood stabilizer thing and I've been going back and forth
i started off on 25 and then I went to 50 75 gradually work my way up to the
full dose and when I got the full doze
I was allowed to go back to school goody
so I went back to school and I got so many questions like people were firing
questions on my throne
what are you like are you okay like are you better now
like what happened like a lot of a lot of people like surprisingly i don't know
i don't know if they were just playing it because like they want to seem like
good people get careless married people
I wouldn't know i'll never know and I'm not not my business
I really don't care um but they're all asking are you okay like you know what
happened I'm just like I'm fine like it I don't want to talk about it
you know I kind of just left in the dark
- I'm just saying like I was in a bad state of mind I'm okay now
but you know
now we're going to fast forward to present day
taking 50 in the morning 50 50 milligrams in the morning 50 milligrams
and night for the medicine on
I still do get depressed because that's not something that just goes away
you know that there's certain things that like mood stabilizers will make it
so that i don't actually feel like hurting myself but it really won't make
me feel less sad
so um I kind of just
yeah that's my situation right now but what I want to do is say that like guys
it's not worth it
like I'm here now and I'm looking back on it and I'm starting to think like if
I would've actually pull it off a lot of people's lives were changed
I left my brother without an older sibling and my whole family was done
because although i didn't see before i do see that I'm a value to my family and
if you don't see that then someone is going to wake you up and you have to see
it yourself
yeah i'm still depressed but i still do see the value of myself
so long story short guys
you can always talk to me I'll put my upline Instagram down below if any of
you guys ever need to talk I'm private but like all except you and you can be
on me anytime
and I will always be here for you guys talk to me rant I don't care if i can do
anything to get you not to have these thoughts and not to do what I almost did
I will do it
all right well that's really not going to say guys thanks for listening and
talk to you guys later
