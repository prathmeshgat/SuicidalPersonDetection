it was a really big for like it's still a blur to me because I shall explain it later but it's a really big blur so it's hard for me to kind of remember what happened 
%HESITATION so you just start off by saying that 
the past couple months %HESITATION you know from October September around that time all the way through on the end of last year two thousand fourteen I I was struggling %HESITATION 
%HESITATION basically I came home from the summer and my parents along my self harm cuts 
and they knew about it from the past 
but they never really did anything about it and I cried to them I told them I was like I need like professional help because of my ex wife actually told me that he's like 
he told me like you need professional help and I was just like I don't really give a shit at the time that I was like yeah I think that you know 
someone on the next day my dad got me a psychiatrist and that was great I'll I'll buy some Hershey's grade and I was seeing a counselor at my school for you know five years ever since I was in year seven 
and so I was getting as much help as I could possibly get and %HESITATION 
after that 
%HESITATION 
other stuff surging back home really because I was on drugs 
and 
that was just ruining my roommate and I was abusing the stuff I was prescribed nd so like that and so is it was just like fuck you know wavering 
and love and %HESITATION 
one time I came home %HESITATION 
I came home one time and mammograms were already having like rough patches and we were like getting along really well and then %HESITATION my Duff out like my drug stash 
and then I blew up completely I was like 
I was just basically being like what the fuck and stuff like ours are saying horrible things to them because 
%HESITATION I don't I really don't know I like you can really explain like I didn't even know like that stuff could come out of my mouth like pretty much came up to my mom's face and I was like 
%HESITATION sharing your back when you sleep you fucking bitch I just I was being completely horrible 
I packed my bags and left home that in the next day and I was staying with my good friends at the time 
and I was just basically out of the house for three weeks and that was a really rough time for me because 
you know I'm not my home I don't feel you know I didn't really feel comfortable not because the people I was staying with but just because you know I feel like I'm just being a burden to people you don't know they wanted me to look up so obviously just a really hard time for me and then %HESITATION 
finally I came back home 
and I already have a suicide attempt before 
%HESITATION before I got kicked out and %HESITATION 
that wasn't a big deal but I 
it was a big deal for me and I wish it was unlike anything big but like the school found out of the school put me on part time so I only went to school three days a week for awhile and I could have I would supervise during free period I was not allowed to leave the classroom to go pee just I'm I'm possible was a break and just like normal obviously actually all watch it wasn't allowed to go out for lunch and slow and and and so it was like you know holy 
in muscle shit happening and %HESITATION 
%HESITATION mice things certain clearing up like things are getting better I was at home by millions exerting better 
and %HESITATION I had to bring the rising concern which I was waiting for four months 
and it's sort of the days of bad because I actually woke up late I took a sleeping pill the night before and had a long time but I actually don't live on the wrong day so is the book late so freaking out I did have time to like get ready all pretty such as like braid my hair like those and then just you are teacher and just left home and then went there %HESITATION I went to you room right I thought you know a teacher unusual six hundred in two years and stuff like that and I don't wanna really talk about 
the girls right now so I'm not gonna you know thrown under the bus you know so but anyways and they usually have like of fallout and they basically like accuse me of stealing their like I saw your hand holding a pink wall and I was like 
and 
%HESITATION and then slowly I just I was just like fuck that I just like and they were they had like a chance and I was like talking to one of the managers can I really want to be pretty horizon 
I was talking to them he gave me his number and everything and he's like you can bring your friends up to they told about whether they are alike 
they care more about like 
to me it's like they do there is precisely because they are the fact that whatever I'm going to go meet Britain's right Georgia did %HESITATION and a good friend named Tiffany was like my bouts right now and %HESITATION 
I was I had a really good to have the concert but in the back of my mind I was still really pissed because I knew like the next day I had school going how my god if I can face 
the girls you know so %HESITATION go right home was from the last station to my station on the train Ammersee which lasted forever like I just cried on it ours is just last me forever 
%HESITATION I went home handling and battery analyze our our whole afternoon Verizon projects Kaufman but they fall asleep 
and I didn't even like bothered to tell my wife in the next day because I was like 
I don't care I don't even consider telling my parents I wasn't going to school out just like I don't care you know I close all the curtains in my room I close the door and realized I slept for like twenty three hours the next day I slept for twenty three hours 
I'm so Monday came around and I was just sleeping lights were off 
currency closer just really depressing it's like solar very what depression is and I'm I'm some of like it will cost to go out and %HESITATION and diagnosed with neurotic depression but 
it's literally what depression is and %HESITATION 
yeah and then I pop some pills of D. exams so 
actually I won't forget this and I took %HESITATION the long lasting ones that were sixty MG at to claim 
six hundred milligrams I don't remember so I was just like fuck for the next couple of days I spent my time at home sleeping 
like with the lights off and like fuckin darkened like my dad which is common spew like you okay you know it's like oh 
and he'd be like 
I don't know what to do if you are just like 
I don't care if he was just like 
I'm sorry like he doesn't know if you know what to do like 
like I didn't I refused to go to school in any when you ask me like he knew what was up I told Melissa 
and like she was just like 
he was being really supportive but in light most distant way ever because we weren't close at the time 
%HESITATION surround Wednesday rolls around 
and I wake up in the morning and I 
we go in the morning 
and it is like the first one I think was awake 
and I called like my friends ok at the time 
can I call him startling body out crying 
and I didn't know what to do and that I like after I hung up like I knew what I was going to do obviously going to kill myself 
I was like I can't do this anymore really act like nobody gave a shit about me I think 
nobody gave a shit about me other spending like my time at home with the lights on you know they computer right next to me you know like all three and no investment usually no one gave a shit about me 
I don't 
and then I was like OneNote as well 
so it wouldn't it wouldn't matter 
so I was like 
if I have to do it 
I have I wanted to do it like the next Monday because it was Wednesday 
so I called my dad because I wanted to do it 
%HESITATION like I had like circling Datin basically he's like I I I I have to tell him that lake %HESITATION I can go to school Monday so that means I could like you know by myself sometime 
so I think 
but he was like oh if you're feeling better why don't you go to school tomorrow as of Thursday and I was like I couldn't say no to him so I was like 
okay so to me when I hung up I was like that means I have to kill myself tonight because I don't want to go to school and I don't want to disappoint him 
so I was like 
okay so I started writing my letter I wrote it down and I wrote it down on paper dnmt pages long but it's pretty fucking long and %HESITATION 
yeah I did that was in the days time I started thinking like I started thinking what I would do you know and 
like I was so convinced that I would die like I was so convinced that I was going to be dead like I did you wasn't going to be an attempt to me like to me I thought I was going to die 
%HESITATION yet so I basically thought I was going to die and %HESITATION so I started thinking like 
what do you do before it looked like what do you do when you know that's going to be your last moments on earth so I started watching like %HESITATION Rudy Francisco which is like 
poetry like spoken poetry 
and that 
I can go back to watching him because it just brings back a lot of memories 
I started 
I'm just thinking like what I would do like I couldn't even like face messaging my mom because I just felt so like upset and the night time rolled around on Wednesday night and my dad you know I'm telling a little and I think your way to go to school tomorrow because I didn't want to disappoint him 
but I knew that he would hardly it would hurt and so much if you didn't get a chance to say goodbye to me if I was going to die 
so I gave him a hug which was like the first time they gave me a really long time because we weren't close that all the time 
and I was just like I start crying mostly 
I'm glad things are getting better and he wished 
yeah me too notes and you know I said goodbye to my little brother I dislike Cody just so they can you know if you saw me how credible he knew something was wrong he knew something was up 
you know it's funny how we do a little seven year old boy can be so god damn smart 
and certain land 
you know I 
I can't I have to do about my house 
so like every time I open the door it makes little noise so I was like I gotta leave around three 
four o'clock 
so I decided like for Clive was going to be four o'clock 
so I actually took a nap from like three I was actually describing this guy who was helping me out 
and 
were you scared me I was mad at him 
and I wasn't going at the school at the time and she was like what are you writing and I was writing something I was writing my suicide letter 
ours is not always like Mr Zeitler and he was just like all cloned don't be like that signal funky overly 
and I started like reading the first paragraph you so why are you doing doesn't he thought I was just kidding 
and also like anyways whatever and then some 
well %HESITATION 
four o'clock rolls around I put my arm like three fifty just put like I'm not wearing any make up and I always wear make up me away hairs and I was just coming here to find out where likes black jacket black leggings it was fucking cold outside I got my drawstring bag I just cried like in it 
because everything was planned out like I know where when I was going to do took me pretty bored 
and %HESITATION I took some money and I basically 
got everything ready 
I put my letter on my dad's desk open the door and I ran out because I thought that they were going to wake up 
I pity burn as fast as I could to the main road and grabbed a taxi and went to this place HMO and it was actually was like rooftop where basically live like it was like my home like I love that place like 
like you know it was abandoned so no one would go up there and I don't talk like maybe two people up there ever at this time 
also I went there and 
I knew that I was going to think for awhile whether I was going to kill myself or not so I brought food up there and like a big bottle of water and like a lot of DX %HESITATION 
and %HESITATION 
so I went there and I fell asleep and 
%HESITATION I pulled out like my phone delightful little part because I thought they were tracked me 
and I don't think I got the title so selfishly didn't think anyone would give a shit because I actually posted it I post my letter online posted Instagram pose a post I message that to some people is that wanted to make as public as I could just so that I would be sure that I would have to die that like I would have to make it like permanent you know and then %HESITATION 
I 
I'm sleeping and I I think it was around ten and I have no clue what time it was sleeping and I just wake up to this banging out the window 
and I look up and I really thought I thought angel like I thought I saw angel because I think it was my friend's friend we were that close at the time and I had no idea how she came there because it's completely up and like nobody knows and go up there 
like you gotta like climb through and slide along this bottom line to get out there 
and I think the first thing I asked you like how did she get up here I'm like shaking and crying 
and she said she just looks at me and she's like some people are stupid some people are 
I was like 
I was that's bass response like the only book I brought with me was %HESITATION catcher in the rye 
and I wanted 
use that to like document how I was feeling just use like right on it like they didn't know how long it was going to be up there 
I learned so the first thing a role in it was white spring here like that's what I asked and she was just being so supportive like 
like incredibly supportive like it wasn't like I'm gonna drag you out of this place what do you do are you sue pressures being like whatever you do it's your choice I can't stop you but she was being like I'm here for you like and I told her I was like you know I'm not just going out 
you know I'm not just gonna walk out of here with you like 
you're gonna be here for awhile and she's like I don't care what she just like I don't care like I really don't care she like I have planned for today but I don't care like you're more important you know that was just like really sweet of her and 
Lynn I took the exam I think it was like eight hundred MG not sure but it was all that was about celebrity and %HESITATION 
but I don't spring got really sick and 
I didn't know what to do if she's puking only given a water like washing your hands like taking care of her 
and I think it was like a tactic from either like call someone because they knew I could like I don't wanna just because she was really sick we should puking I just felt so badly I don't know what to do with 
normally I would've just like gone out 
I'm just going to help but like I'm like kind of stuck so it was kinda like her tactics like 
to me she's like I need to call like Tina her sister and I was like okay so we try to work her phone stuff like that I don't really remember a lot of it like it's like everything was blurry from that week 
and then nobody accepts hitting me and I'm like completely gross I don't make up on and suddenly life Max up there and I don't remember how we got there and I don't really remember seeing him 
not sure what time comes around but like 
and suddenly like my dad's next to me I don't understand because you know complete retard like I don't understand 
and I'm like 
so confused goes so slow and then 
apparently Healy carried me out of the studio 
and %HESITATION then he puts me in his car and I see my friends at the time leases child I'm Colin and I hope he straps Mian I don't remember seeing the girls at all but actually it just like amazed because he found me because 
%HESITATION everyone was like fine welcome by the welcome the police what the welcome there like I don't know where you are and it's like where she I don't know but 
because I was the one who found a penny board outside because I left it downstairs 
and that's how he knew I was like around so that like when my dad told me that in the hospital I start crying anyways they took me to the hospital my mom was driving with someone was driving and %HESITATION 
going to the hospital and the speed is like completely boring to me I just remember like 
lots of lights and like nurses coming around me and I'm like them putting stuff my hands and arms and 
and 
children should just like that stuff 
and 
%HESITATION my dad's like putting his arm over and I'm holding it 
and like I didn't know who was but because he has hairy arms I knew it was my dad 
and he's just telling me and I just look at him and I start high 
her like I'm so sorry I don't think he was going to be bad and 
he said to me is like no this is one of this second best day of my life 
because his first birthday was when I'm being would be my sister moved him 
and that he's a relative but like his best day of his life isn best day when I found out that you were alive and I was like well you know I 
Ghaziabad antiques and it's like a really weird crying you know nnj 
and 
I basically started crying and he's just like 
he's like twelve twelve 
well I don't want my when your sister message me and was like you know how that is a lie we founder 
and I couldn't believe that my sister or my brother 
my brother likes found he like he 
we used to hate each other Alegria hate each other so much like 
so incredibly like we we feature the like a punch the one thing we have like the worst link relationship ever for that I like found basically he was the one who was trying to find he was like give me this number like he was like this like my dog called it like a spotlight trying to find me and I started crying when I heard that and my dad was like twelve twelve would like 
no time we found you so now like ever since twelve isn't unlike my lucky number like I have twelve thoughts on each finger and was just spectacular annnnd 
and then so I stay in the hospital overnight 
%HESITATION Thursday night so Friday morning when I came back 
the like morning and it was the worst night in the hospital like it was fucking cold and I couldn't Peavey is also on the exam and I have my own private room and like I don't know I think the doors were locked like I was I was not allowed to open the doors only the nurses could open the doors so if I want to go out I would have to leave banged on the doors unlike look up at the camera for like 
a good five minutes until he could open and let me go out here and I can even be able 
and I'm 
I'm still like I get I see different psychiatrists like around three different six psychiatrists 
within like the day 
and %HESITATION 
and I keep telling them like I can't understand what you're saying because I am hi I was just so like everything was shifting of getting gravity shifts are just so like fucked up right 
and 
but I could still I understand so often 
%HESITATION 
nearly all day I would see my normal psychiatrists and just things were getting back to normal and then okay so that's basically my exercise draped like when I came home I got a hundred and three messages even from people I don't know I got twenty five friend because 
and just so many people post on my wall like praying for you kinda like actually showed me that like 
some people actually give a shit 
%HESITATION 
pretty much and I just got support from a lot of people and ever since that time and never had like one bad day 
and that was like a good month and something like a like I've not had one bad day every day has been so great for Mimi my dagger jogging a lot together me and him are like so close armor hang out with my family I've made really good friends and I've basically never been happier than I've ever been in such a long time
