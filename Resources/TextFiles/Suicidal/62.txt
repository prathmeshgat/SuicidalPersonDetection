usually make it back you all made it out here like 30 minutes ago but I was on
the phone and i SAT here and I was just thinking okay let's see what these back
streets are you I'm just not looking up with these nanny jobs like they're all
far as crap and this is somebody who are already applied to this is 37 minutes
yes I actually not really that bad
37 minutes and i'm not still in the best
from today luckily the girl who wanted me to give her that tour
she and that's a very special into tomorrow for families get settled and
stuff and I was gonna be a conflict with the time that I said I can do it but I'm
still a little bit mad i had a breakdown in school when I was doing my first
class and I cried my eyes out like a baby in the bathroom
in the end i went to my second class and then i just i was going to vlog I just
was not feeling it and then when I start crying I wasn't feeling more and then i
have this is not me do tomorrow
it's a group assignment beyond the hospital group assignment this is not a
good day only good thing about this day was think my stand
let me see my skin is not it's oily as it usually is i use my Mac primer that I
you want to make about whatever sorry got
hey guys oh my god so this is not
just a good day for me it's like really really sucky like i have started feeling
better because I finally have bound a family within a distance you know not
too far away
I'm a mom it wasn't too far so i have an interview with her own line
thursday i was like okay it's gonna be a good day for the rest of the day rather
and they're not trying to finish my group work and then I was like okay I
need a destruction to make time go far go by faster so that i can go to sleep
so i started watching a bachelor and this
I don't know what season it is but the bachelor is crisp
so yeah definitely i'm watching on demand and then
so one of the contestants I guess looks like sharing the story with him and was
talking about like how her husband had committed suicide and she would tell the
story like I she said she didn't know he had a mental illness before they got
married and then they had a child and then like seven months after the child
was born he just started acting crazier and you start seeing a lot of different
changes so she took the baby and live and then like she just had never seen
him like that
and it's just what the concern of her and then she says you remember getting a
message one day stand i'm sorry and he loved her and then on her way home she
just had like a feeling in her good that that something bad happened when she got
home she found out that he was dead he killed though and it was like one of the
hardest experiences of her life and I could just resonated with me because she
just kept talking about like she didn't know what she could have done
differently and i want i guess it just let me get myself together like I guess
I should just cut to the chase
like when i was 16 i remember me trying to commit suicide and like that was one
of the hardest point of my life because like i went from being such a happy
person and in heaven
like everything that I needed as far as family friends education in the end
getting in a rough situation with someone who I thought cared about me and
then like friendship started falling apart and it
family issues cup arise in and it just became so unbearable that I just
remember coming home every day judges seemed like like I don't want to be here
anymore and i use the gym closed my eyes and just say about my heater and just
hold my breath as long as I could possibly hold it and and just pray i
just didn't wake up from it and then when that wasn't working i remember me
put in like a plastic bag over my head and was like okay I'm gonna go through
with it this time
and like I just couldn't want to start started losing air like there was just
too much to bear side of the bag off and and just crawl back in my bed and get
some uh stuff like what can I do what can I go through with it in and it's
just so hard is just knowing how many people in this world have actually gone
through with it it's been so many times where I could have been a victim of so
starting like I use its prey and prey because I'm like this is against my
religion I don't want to
at the supper because of this and it was just so crazy and it's a shame but i
have to talk about this because you know when we got to the hospital and the as
have you ever tried to commit suicide may try to put you in crazy places and
then I had to go to counsel and owned it was just like a terrible part of my
life and like hear her talk about it it just brought back so many memories
because even still to this day like one thing it's so bad with me I'm just like
why am I here like what is my purpose and like I just want to be more
appreciative of being never have the opportunity to be and will live another
day and and I don't want to take my life I haven't thought about it
edges you know get so frustrated sometimes like why do bad things always
happen to me or you know it's just crazy I know y'all probably going to be like
Oh Keisha like you're so stupid and stuff I'm just I don't know it's just I
wasn't going to even pick up the camera and talk about it but I just feel like
if I would have been able to see somebody else to wade through what I was
going through like it would help me out so much because such a long we place of
your life like if you got to have just seemed like it was easy like I was just
so miserable and unhappy with life and I couldn't
sorry shivering because i had to turn the light on and I'm really cold but
like it was just so miserable and I'm so happy that I got out of the sea and I
don't think I would ever have to go back to being that depressed where I don't
want to be any more our attempt to take my life I prayed over it and I know to
just go to people if I feel like a minute place again
I just not saying that just because all the also mad earlier today that i was
thinking about it
it's just sometimes like I don't know how to handle emotions and
and i know it comes from like when I since i have a panic disorder like some
people are diagnosed with things because this just doesn't but they were
diagnosed with or born with or just came out of nowhere but me
it wasn't genetics or hereditary it just came because of my actual life
experiences and I've been through so much as a young age I'm only 21 and I've
been through hell and back and I just trying to be like thankful because it
could have been way words like this could happen or like I could have
seriously seriously ended up in a condition where I was like this is a
boring some type of way because of the house of beer
xiah tea and Panik became for me and I don't want to ever have to start your
stupid stuff but oh I don't ever want to have to be that person or have to hear
about anybody else being that person so I just figure it's it's like she was
able to share with someone like something so even though she wasn't the
one who committed suicide of course but being someone who doesn't understand and
I mean it's hard to talk about
if you see your friend or family member feeling down or not acting as normal as
that are
I really highly recommended to look into it and don't stop even if they say don't
know
the top because I'm not always felt about it and it was just so it was it
was so great you guys in
huh I've grown up so much from there and I can really say I've grown up because
there's not like a childish mentality to want to commit so with that I think
that's just sometimes people go to things that really are unbearable and
some people are more fortunate than others and I'm so happy that I'm
fortunate and I have thousands of people were going to watch the story and judge
me because of what I've been through
so we're gonna say good I'm going to say bad but i just want to be able to come
back and look one day and say like like that like i was able to get through it
and talk about it and be okay and that's one of the main reasons why I wanted to
start a YouTube channel is because I do want to come back and watch my life
unfold before my eyes
granite I'm able to live for a long long time my kids can go back and see me and
i will let them see this I want them to understand who their mother is it and
everything like that but most importantly I want to be able to come
and look back at my coming out story and see how strong I wasn't always video
then and in videos like this where I'm able to just be as vulnerable as I
possibly can
it's hard it's really really hard sharing your life at this capacity and I
know there's always told her I want to do with the shooting
so I'm not share that so you get this is just one part of my life that now you
guys know and like i see it i hope if anybody else is going through they're
going to suicidal thoughts or feeling deeply deeply depressed where they don't
want to be here like you you reach out to someone because things could win a
whole nother way for me
luckily my mom is nosy and she looked through my room all the time because she
was going to clean it and she found letters that I used to write to myself
or to my ex indeed and things are going to get changed before they got worse
but this is this the think like I could visit we see myself sitting on the floor
in my room thinking like that I didn't want to be here and I like some time
legends one that just wake up and just feel loved and cared about and
appreciated by someone in that somebody is happy for me to be a part of their
lives and I just hope I'm doing my part and I try so hard like a dress so hard
to like be a good daughter a sister a girlfriend and student like I thought so
offer but like I can't be perfect
I can't live up to everyone's expectations but my own
I can just try and I just hope that you guys can see like i try to be a good
role model for people who are young we are watching me I try to be done is they
and like I don't know I guess I just be myself up sometimes and I just really
hope like you guys really get positive things when you watch my videos I know
every time is not going to always be positive but for the most part
overall hope you gotta think positive things because I just don't like
reminiscing on that part of my life but I know it's good for me to know
if I don't remember that it happened like that you try to block those things
out in the end you explore eventually and I don't like talking about it not
with friends not with family
like I don't like talking about it with anyone i usually just keep it bottled up
inside of me and I think it's just easier from you just pick up this camera
even I know tomorrow at eleven so many people will be watching it but right now
it's just me and I don't have to
I don't go be weird about it or feel funny or ashamed of Who I am where my
past because that's that's really a part of me
so you know I guess that was it in
I'm really proud of myself for going through with it like I said I was like
no you don't pick up that camera don't do it to yourself just cry it out cry it
out but I'm happy and hopefully even if I just help one person out there who
watches this and one person can be helped and yes so I think I'm pretty
much going to end this blog because oh yeah this is like a 12 minute clip
already so I already know you don't want to sit through of another five minutes
we'll be talking so asses in the log right here and I'll see you guys
tomorrow
bye
