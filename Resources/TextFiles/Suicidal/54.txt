hey what's up you guys first of all yes i know my hair looks like a helmet right
now and I kind of look like a lego man and all the comments probably going to
be talking about that which is sad because this video is about suicide
so let's stay on topic shall we um yes
today's video is going to be a little bit more serious than my usual as you
most of you probably know
paris Jackson Michael Jackson's daughter attempted to end her life
a few days ago and it really struck a chord in me for a few reasons one is
because anytime I child tries to kill themselves is the most heartbreaking
thing in the whole world
I've made a lot of videos about it and number two I know her
I mean we don't were not like we don't like kick it like we're not chillin
she's like 14 that be weird but you know she's tweeted my videos i've tweeted her
we've had a little Twitter conversation she cut her hair to look just like mine
not saying she did but she did it and and she's been really sweet and friendly
and we were supposed to do a video together while ago and it didn't happen
because i think my stuff might be a little bit too raunchy not a shock
anyways when I heard about the news
it broke my fucking heart I was devastated because first of all it's
michael jackson's kid
she's been through enough you know and second of all there was so much media
coverage about it saying things like she's just doing it for attention and
she didn't really want to kill herself it was only because she wanted to be
more famous and I mean things that are just like how could you say that like I
make fun of celebrities all the time
I could never ever make fun of the celebrity is trying to kill me
anyways back to the point point is i feel like i'm making this video is way
too often feel like I've made a suicide video like every year and it's not good
and i just want to once again explained to you guys
why it's not a good idea well hi
why attempting to kill yourself is the worst idea you know
as most of you know I had a very rough childhood horrible and down as many
times as i thought to myself maybe I should end it
I didn't because I knew that you know what
it sucks right now but I'm going to make it fucking better in 10 years when I'm
24
it's gonna be awesome and that didn't happen
so maybe in another 10 years 134 it will be awesome but you got to keep looking
ahead and you can't focus on the past because that's the main problem and
that's one reason why a lot of people try to kill themselves
that's one reason i used to struggle with those thoughts because you focus on
the past and you don't move forward
you know what I just SAT and focus on the past all day
I would be emotionally eating myself into the ground and I would never be
making videos i would just be crying and then you guys won't be laughing
I mean you might be laughing at me that you wouldn't be laughing sorry I'm
strange
I'm nervous I don't like talking about suicide but I i need to because I know a
lot of you guys leave me comments especially the Paris thing happened a
lot and I tweeted about it a lot of you guys tweeted me and said well I think
about killing myself
how come you don't care about me all I tried to kill myself how come you don't
care
and that's not true i do care but sadly there's way too many kids out there were
trying to kill themselves for me to give personal attention to each and every one
of you
which is why I'm making this video so if you're watching this and you're thinking
about killing yourself you're thinking that life
wow this is getting deep why do i do this ok are fucking let's get you if
you're watching this you're thinking about killing yourself and you think
that the world would be a better place without you and you think that your
parents and your friends and anybody your dog fucking turtle you think those
people are going to be better without you you are wrong
somebody is going to miss you and somebody is going to be really fucking
mad at you if you do i'm gonna be fucking that you and I mean fucking kill
you
I mean
I might know you want to it and I know your twitter picture or your creepy
hashtags that you sent me and you call yourself an awesome horse which is weird
but I minute
I'm gonna fucking cry about it and that's fucked up
so what I want from you guys if you're feeling is these things these terrible
things and I totally understand if you are because being a kid sucks
please find something that makes you happy
find new creative outlet it might be You Tube make videos draw color paint
walk your dog because you know what your dog means you my dog needs me and I'm
completely ignoring her right now so I should probably do something about that
but you need to put that energy into something else parents if you're
watching this which I kind of hope you're not because I hope you're just
resting
but if you're watching this you have so much talent
I know you do I fucking know it you use that don't you so fuck that shit
because we need you we need to see what you're going to do next we want to see
it
and that goes for everybody watching this I want to see what you guys are
going to do next and fucking better not kill yourself
so also i'm leaving in the description of some links to suicide prevention
hotlines and websites and places to get tips and places to talk to other teams
i'm going to look up all of that shit i'm going to put it on the description
for you guys to look at and we got to stop this guy's I can't make another
suicide video i made so many and it's getting really depressing and I'm crying
on
it's sad and down and I know how you're feeling I've had friends that have been
suicidal and I've talked to them and you know I understand how hard life is
get it and she's done with it and I know me saying that might not make you feel
better
but but it makes me feel a little bit better that at least I said something
because i could not live with myself if I didn't tell you every day how much out
i'm going to go i love you guys and I better see you tomorrow
