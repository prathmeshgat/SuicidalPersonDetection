hey guys welcome to episode 4 of cat tests today is a more personal video a
few of you guys have asked me to do
embrace the day for some reason things iety isn't that funny
a lot of you guys have asked me to do a video on how I deal with my anxiety my
anxiety story and all that stuff
and at first i was debating if we should do this video not because it is a little
bit more personal and sometimes people can't really deal with other people
expressing their feelings and sometimes people don't care actually
ninety percent of people do not care about how you feel so this video is for
those of you who have asked for this type of video if you are someone who
really doesn't give a crap about anxiety my anxiety or my story because i will be
explaining to you guys how I developed anxiety on certain things that happened
to me in my life I will be talking about them
so this is going to be a long video probably really boring so if you have no
interest in that
please only many negative comments below just exit out and go in your room and
hopefully I can help at least one person i will be talking about like how I cope
with it and stuff at the end of the video I will be talking more about like
my life and I have and what I think caused by anxiety
so my entire life I had a really really great childhood I had a really good life
growing up not saying I don't have a really good life now and just think
growing up I thought I was like the luckiest little kid ever
I went to disney world all the time
I had great parents have I have great parents and I honestly felt like I had
the perfect family from my parents I am the only child that they had together
before my dad married my mom he had a son before my mom married my dad he had
my sister let and my brother Johnny
I grew up with my brother Johnny let like my whole life so I don't really see
them as half hate that word
I'm going to see them as half brothers and sisters there are my blood they are
like we came out of the same area you know i have seen just want to point out
there just in case anybody gets confused about the way but anyway so I had a
really really good childhood and right after high school
maybe not right after but very soon after high school
my life kind of just hit a brick wall at least in my opinion at least that's what
it felt like that I could I could honestly say that 2011 was the worst
year in my entire life
I don't want to really get into too much detail because i will start crying like
a psycho here and that's just awkward
I'm one day oh my god I'm already going to start growing a one day my mom just
told me your dad and I are getting divorced
I've been married for like twenty one years
and they were together in my entire life so it kind of was really really shocking
to see like me as an 18 year old
my whole life I kept my parents up in a pedestal like while my parents are
divorced so many parents are divorced I'm so lucky so lucky
and that happened and my parents you know that was happening and I was 18 and
it's so weird because you always hear about how kids really suffer through
divorces like the younger they are the more they suffer
which I'm sure that's absolutely true i don't know i wasn't in that position but
people seem to think that because you're older you're 18 that a divorce does not
affect a child even if you are an adult and it absolutely does
I I grew up my whole life with my mom and my dad in the same house under the
same roof
I never had to go to two Christmases two birthdays - Thanksgivings I always felt
so bad for like the kids in my school or my friends or my cousins who did so
being such a close family my mom was my best friend my whole life and then after
so long that kind of stopping
I didn't take it very well it was something i was not used to you know I
was in a routine all the time I'm very afraid of change I've always been afraid
of change I've always hated it
I like routine and because of my age because i was 18 years old
they didn't feel the need to keep certain things from me
but as a parent when you're going through a divorce and you have young
children you don't fight in front of the children you don't do certain things in
front of the kids because they don't understand and they don't get a divorce
but as an 18 year old
I have absolutely understand the horse and they thought I was an adult so they
just you know I saw all the ugliness that happened
front and center I witnessed little I want to respect my parents and not so
much but it was not a pretty divorce and I saw it all
first hand I remember I was going to live with my mom really close after they
told me about the divorce I was going to move in with her in an apartment while
Danny was here in Mississippi you know before i left with him to come live here
I was going to live with her an apartment i remember walking into the
apartment and looking around and then going into the bathroom and crying for
like an hour in the bathroom because i live in the same house for 18 years and
kind of like the thought of me living somewhere else
that was in my home with my parents it was weird and then a couple ones after
my parents told me they were getting divorced I told my parents I was getting
married it was it was super awkward timing but honestly a commentary at the
perfect perfect time because Danny took me away from all that toxic negative
energy that was going on so so yeah I told my parents that I was getting
married you know while they were going up while they were going through a
divorce it was very very weird for my dad my dad was like you know whatever
makes you happy
he didn't get it but he was you know very very very comforting about it
whatever makes you happy my mom loved a nice my mom was all for it you know so
that happened
and
I took I didn't take it very well but I was ok i would I mean I wasn't ok but i
was i was fine and then I got married I left to Mississippi
my mom got her own place she moved in with her mom and then my dad stayed at
our home so my dad kept the house and you know things were ok they were fine
and then to anyone on deployment and back to Miami to stay with my dad to
stay in the home that I grew up in because that's where I felt the most
comfortable
my dad was in the process of looking for a home
he really wanted to move to tampa just kind of like get away from everything
which I totally understood i did not like going back home at all
for that reason so one day I'm i was staying at my house my dad's house with
my grandma and he left on his motorcycle my that rides a motorcycle
he left on his harley davidson to go to tampa to see a property to see like a
certain house and I remember sitting in my room like bloom in the mirror and
playing with a sedona lace eyeshadow palette and my friend America had just
come over and then around three in the morning i got a huge knock on the door
like a crazy bang and my grandmother open the door and there were two cops
standing right in front of me and my the cop was like going to the mother of
Eddie my dad and she was like and he was like he was in a really terrible
motorcycle accident and I remember looking at the cop and I asked him
um is he alive like that's the only thing asked and the guy was like I don't
know and I kind of like don't remember what happened after that I remember like
throwing myself on the floor like not being able to breathe and my friend
America was like let's go get in my car i'm taking you to camp because it
happened in town so we had to drive to it was like four hour drive or like a
three-hour drive we have to drive to tap on general hospital and we met up with
my uncle and my aunt there and I remember when we got there everybody he
was an intensive care and everybody who walked in and see my dad walked out like
sobbing hysterically and
I was like I'm not going in there I'm not gonna go in there and they were like
going there that's your dad what if that's the last time you're able to see
him
all and I was like well if it is the last time I'm going to see him I want
the memory to be a good one and him not all cut up in his face or anything like
that so I'm not going in there my dad would not want me to go in there and see
him
so a couple days later we were still in tampa and he was recovering really well
actually it was they have the best doctors there or something because his
recovery happens really fast and really good and my dad ended up having a
traumatic brain injury TBI
so long story short after about a week when he got home you have to wear a neck
brace and stuff and he looked perfectly fine like besides the neck brace
physically it's like nothing happened to him but the you know TBI is pretty
pretty serious
so a couple days later my dad started acting really really strange she was
acting really weird seem really weird things and you know out of respect for
my dad I'm not going to go into detail but I got it got ugly
my dad wasn't wasn't like I don't know he was acting like a completely
different man
and I remember like the scariest stuff would happen and it was that I couldn't
sleep I couldn't think i remember around my dad's accident
I didn't sleep for weeks and then we ended up finding out that his brain was
bleeding internally and nobody knew because you know what's in his head
nobody had no one knew
so you went back to the hospital and
and you know things got better I don't wanna I don't want to like disrespect
him and talk about this
so I don't know I feel we're talking about it but he ended up going back home
and he's fine right now he's doing great
I'm he still has TB is that doesn't go away not that not that he still has like
TV I like a brain injury he doesn't anymore but for example he has a
short-term memory loss like he'll be talking to you and he'll be like yeah
because you know i was sitting down and have something like what was I just
talking about you know like he has short-term memory loss
so I thank God thank God because there's no one else i could possibly think that
my dad is alive and well to this they
thank you God because hit was traumatising it was the worst year of my
life
the divorce happier than right after that you know my dad's accident happened
and during the accident the divorce was still going on because it takes a long
time to get divorced like I swear it was like the longest process ever for my
parents to finally get divorced and it was still it was ugly and nate till this
day that can't even see each other like I don't that big
so after the accident you know things were ok I have to Danny was back from
deployment i went i came back to Mississippi and everything was fine then
daddy had to go on deployment again and when I went back to mad at me for some
reason this time all the memories of like the accident the divorce up like it
was like it weight on top of me the whole time that I was there and then I
remember was September 16 sep some sep tember 16
Danny was on deployment I remember waking up and it couldn't breathe I woke
up not being able to breathe
so my mom took me to the hospital and he was like here here take some xanax
it takes mechanics it made it worse I have to go back to the hospital again
that day because the xanax
it made it worse I really felt like I was on this year when I was taking that
next not a real soldier but I felt super jittery I didn't like it and then it
didn't stop for an entire month 30 days are like 35 days around there i had
anxiety from the moment i woke up to the moment I went to sleep and since I
wasn't used to that
I really i thought it was the end of the world it was about I've always been the
type of person who had what they called social anxiety or like General on the
situation or anxiety
growing up I never liked to go out partying I didn't like to go to a club I
didn't like to be around places where there were so many people I've had
paranoia issues since I was younger I had nothing to do with like anything
that happened with my parents but I've always been just a strange individual
since I was really young so I didn't like to go out but every time my friends
would like a persuade me to go somewhere and there were a lot of people i would
get anxiety but the second that I would leave the party or the place
my anxiety would go away so that was the kind of anxiety that was super easy to
deal with for me because I knew what the problem was it was the fact that i was
at a party with too many people and I know how to fix that
leave the party so I know how to solve the problem
so it was really easy for me to deal with that I never really cared about
that kind of anxiety but this anxiety happens and i would wake up with it and
go to sleep and wake up with a ghost of it and I didn't know how to solve the
problem
so it gave me more anxiety and I felt like I couldn't breathe
I would go to the hospital very often because I felt like an open was sitting
on my chest
my dad was like you really need to see someone you need to go to a psychologist
you know so I did and that
when psychologists a really great one I'm really lucky that I have a really
good psychologist and you know she was telling me like you have really bad
anxiety so i ended up seeing a psychiatrist psychologist kind of talk
to you about your problems and psychiatrist prescribe medication and
when I went to my psychiatrist
he basically told me i had anxiety with panic disorder
I forgot what general anxiety Africa it was general anxiety with panic disorder
because I would have panic attacks
very very often like throughout the whole month like I was just like not
being able to breathe like freaked out and I would have panic attacks so he
gave me like two bills one that I was supposed to take on a daily basis and
one that I would only take one I had a panic attack and i took this one that I
was supposed to take every day for about a month and hated it I felt so bad i was
like i'm not going to be a slave to a pill i'm not gonna do this I'm gonna
conquer this on my own at this pill i'm not going to do it so I federal way
those pills and I only kept the ones that would call me down if I had a panic
attack
so whenever I have really really really bad anxiety or a panic attack
I take that home and then I feel a lot better so that pill stays with me in my
purse at all times because it really really helps me but I decided I wasn't
going to do the pill everyday thing because I was stronger than that
at least that's what i told myself so we know I would tell my psychologist like I
don't understand what's happening
and she basically brought it out and told me you know like having that
traumatic experience of your parents divorce and your dad's accident
happening so close together
it's called it cause the anxiety but the second you left
it's like you left all that behind so you didn't feel it bother you but when
you came back down to Miami and all the memories hit you like a ton of bricks
it triggered your anxiety
and that's when it really really hit you which made so much sense because uh huh
I love to my having all my friends are there I love being with my dad like I
love living with my dad i love being there with my dad loved it so much i
wish i was there now I'm I said I kept like I kept replaying like the accident
in my head like whatever I would look at his bike he doesn't ride his bike
anymore
thank God but it's sitting kind of like in in the house whenever I would look at
the bike i would think of the accident whenever I would you know certain things
that I would look at would trigger those memories and it was just it was that I
really thought that I was gonna feel like that for the rest of my life and
you would scare me so bad I would time like I don't want to feel like this for
the rest of my life
I don't know what I'll do if i wake up with anxiety for the rest of my life
I don't know what I will do honestly my dad was the only one who understood
nobody else understood my anxiety I didn't know anybody else who had anxiety
accept my cousin but nobody understood it and my and my psychologist made a
really really good . which if you if any of you guys have anxiety which I would
think so if you're watching this video but if any of you guys have anxiety just
keep this in mind because it really really did help me because I kept trying
to explain to people like certain people in my family started people and like
certain group of friends
no you know I can't go out because I have anxiety and my friends were like
you can't go out because you have anxiety
so you can come hang out with me because you have anxiety okay yeah sure
and I psychologists explained it to me like no one is going to tell that your
foot is broken
unless you have a cast on it that and that stayed with me and really did help
me because it's true
anxiety is
is a mental thing it's something that happens inside so you physically look
perfectly fine but it's something that's going on inside your body
so no one is going to understand it because they don't feel the anxiety
so if there's one thing I can tell you guys is do not try to explain anxiety
and other people they will make you feel like you're crazy
certain people will be like oh ok hey it's not
there's no cast on your foot so no one's going to know your foot is broken so if
you're really feeling really really upset
may we talk to a psychologist or talk to someone you know is really really good
at listening and really is understanding because most of the time people didn't
understand and that doesn't make you crazy that doesn't make your problem
any less of a problem or any less important because people don't get it
that's not true so one day after a lot of praying and a lot of like hoping you
know one day I woke up and I didn't have anxiety after a whole month and I was
like oh my god I don't feel so bad and I got some anxiety that day but it wasn't
a constant thing for the whole day so that kind of woke me up and I was like
wait a minute i can come for this I can do this I can do this
so basically and what has helped me i know that was super long
I just wanted to explain to you what caused my anxiety but what really really
helped me was going to a psychologist you're not crazy people to psychology if
you see a therapist you are not greatly
some people don't believe in therapy and if you don't that's fine
I think it helps that's just me another thing is my psychologist told me to
really delete the bad things in your life delete the bad people I had some
friends who didn't understand who really kind of poked fun at my anxiety and
psychologists was like you really need to get rid of those friends and surround
yourself with loving people people who make you happy
you know like the kind of friends you have that when you're around them you
just feel really good
so that's what i did i start hanging on my friend Gabby and krista and they just
they got me you got me and I kind of deleted certain people out of my life
who just were toxic and we're drowning me made me feel worse than I already
felt so if you have people like that in your life try to delete them as hard as
it's going to be afraid of focus your energy on happy people because people
who give off
positivity you kind of like absorb the positivity
if you're around people who are always happy and like a really appreciate life
and make you feel good as a person
you will feel good as a person if that makes any sense also try to break the
habit
I thought that if I left my dad's house I would have anxiety so I literally
locked myself up in my room and I watched charmed for a whole month
because of my fear was on my god as soon as they leave this house i'm going to
get anxiety i know that's what it is
I'm going to get anxiety as soon as I leave this house which wasn't true
by the way I have OCD so that played a major part in to that I felt that if I
left my house
something bad would happen I would have anxiety but anyway try to break the
habit you know
force yourself even though it's hard leaving the house gives you anxiety for
example I would try to get in my car and then go down the street drives down the
street and then drive back and then go back home and I would and I would be
like okay I got in my car and I drove down the street and you know I survived
I didn't have a panic attack so little by little I just kind of started going
out more and like seeing people more
another thing that really helped me with some exercise like meditation kind of
like breathing exercises that we would might mean my psychologist down on the
couch and she would make me breathe in like hold my breath and then breathe out
wow that really helps me all lot like every time I have
I'm having a panic attack on the verge of a panic attack i do those breathing
exercises
I breathe in hold my breath for like 30 seconds or less
that seems like a lot and then I would breathe out and you kind of feel your
heart kind of like calming down breathing exercises really work
regular exercise is really work because panic attacks make my heart beat really
really fast when I want to go jogging you know your heart races really fast
when you're jogging but it's a different kind of heart be I'm not explain it
jogging really really helped
it keeps your mind off of the anxiety and you know the endorphines and all
that stuff
it really helps anxiety another thing is don't eat too much fast food because
while i was going through a really bad anxiety
I would invest with all the time and i found it made it worse when I would eat
like at my sister's house and I will eat healthier food
I felt more relaxed and it wouldn't give me anxiety so bad foods can give you
anxiety believe it or not
another thing I recommend is writing if you don't like to write then that's a
different story but write in your journal
happy things write down things that make you happy but that you can go back and
read them and then appreciate your lives more actually had a journal that i kept
while my parents were going through the divorce and while my dad had the
accident and I have to burn the journal
I literally had to sell my journal on fire because reading it cause so much
pain because i wasn't so much pain as i was writing it
anybody who can read that journal would have thought that I was like dying worse
like the worst life ever because I would just write all the really bad emotions
and I have to get rid of the journal so I recommend writing down happy thoughts
if you want to have a journal to write down me like all of the pain you're
feeling that's fine but then have a separate one to write all your happy
thoughts and happy memories in because go back and you read it and it kind of
makes you think like you know what
my life isn't that bad though yeah just try to think about happy things and I
know that everybody says that but it is true
positivity is so important when you have anxiety because i feel like it brings
the light to your life
those are just things that really helped me till this day i will have the
occasional panic attack and I have anxiety like I've had anxiety this
entire video but i'm able to live my life because I know it is temporary
keep it in your mind at all times I'm not going to feel like this forever
I have a panic attack but guess what I'll take something or drink something
or I'll do something that will make me feel better and then it will be gone and
will be in the past
this is a temporary thing i had to write really big on my wall
this too shall pass I wrote it with paint on my wall in my bedroom and I
kept telling myself like this too shall pass this too shall pass because it will
it will your pain will not last you forever it really will not i promise you
I thought I was gonna die because i woke up with anxiety for 35 days and it
didn't go away and I thought okay this is what the rest of my life is going to
look like
but it's not it isn't there is a light at the end of the tunnel
I hope you understand that I hope I promise you that you will not feel like
this forever and the more you tell yourself that like you know what this is
temporary this temporary I could do this I'm strong enough to it to conquer this
then
the faster you will heal or the faster you'll feel better
yeah I'm gonna wrap this video up because i feel like it is 35 minutes
long
maybe longer
I don't know I kind of just wanted to share with you guys you know there
there's good in life and there's a lot of bad things in life and there's a lot
of things that cause anxiety and then you feel like you really are rock bottom
and you feel the worst thing you can possibly feel and you feel like you
cannot breathe and you cannot go anywhere or be around anyone without
having a panic attack but that's not true
this too shall pass and you'll feel better I promise
just you know try to do the certain little things that I said and check if
that works
my advice is not the best i'm sure that people other people will give you better
advice but this is just how I was able to deal with my anxiety and yeah I hope
this helped at least one person probably didn't but I hope it
thank you guys so much for watching i love you guys I love you guys so much
