oh hi so today i got an email asking me about self-harm and i decided that i
would talk about it on as many of you may know or may not know actually I to
have self-harmed myself
sorry it's a little difficult for me to talk about because it's not something I
want to talk about because always a negative thing but hey if its shine some
light on you or help someone then I guess it's that's all that matters
ok so i wasn't like so I didn't like myself like super deep like I was never
like one of those people that like really wanted like to create a scar
I just on would take a pick apart my like razor my shaving razor and use
those to cut and make art on my arms and my legs
preferably my thighs and i would write sayings in it
I like for my name my boyfriend's name the one who cheated on me so many times
and I would draw stars and hearts and such and it made me feel better
I don't know why but it felt like at the time I was numb and I don't know why but
it made me feel better
and when I look back upon it it was just because I was sorry sorry I look I don't
know if it's it wasn't the fact that it was making me feel better
it was just giving me something to do other than on thinking i guess like the
pain I was causing myself was was better than other people causing me pain and
we're thinking of all the other people around me that were hurting me
constantly
ok
but um I don't believe that self harming yourself is a good thing and I don't
believe that it helps in the long run because I'm and never help me help me
for a split second and maybe you feel better
sorry
it was only wow how did it look like a dumbass
sorry I'm sorry it was only a temporary solution to the problem and i know a lot
of people would like when they cut themselves
it's you know much deeper and a lot of people are trying to kill themselves and
that it's not that should not be a choice because life is about the life is
supposed to be happy and life is was a real good life is all about joy and
sorry if you are a subpar results
just know that it gets better things to get better and just should not to resort
to that there's so much to love of my life there's so much so much love so
much abundance so much everything around you and you just need to embrace it and
realize it
I know you're going through a rough time but things do get better and just
believe me I just I just don't think that self-harming is the way to go and
there are things that you can do to preoccupy your time like music or you
know things that kind of calm you down relax use that you in a better mood or
whatever movie maybe in you know and just kind of wait out and start thinking
happy thoughts and start you know put put the negativity into something
positive and do something good for yourself and progress because if you're
in this negative spot you're just saying all these negative things and you're
just going to go down down down and you don't want to go down
nobody wants to go down everyone wants to go up the switches listen to me and
just go up and just do something good for yourself
start exercising started I don't know eating out the earth is something to
occupy your time
other than that ok so that's how I feel about it
I don't want to talk about it anymore okay
