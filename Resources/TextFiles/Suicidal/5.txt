I don't even know what's going on in my mind more 
my mind works which I'm still trying to figure out in one of the biggest things 
I want to grow as a person is to figure out what's going on my mind 
and I've been trying to do this by you know going to doctor use or 
analyzing little details everyone knows if anyone knows me I like details you know even with my arm very detailed hard every dog is there for like a meaning if anyone wants to compliment me and it's someone I know I like when they 
tell me little details eyes and I was the way your fingers looks when you're holding a cigarette or I remember the way you chew when you have a nice clean or something like that something small like that but what goes on in my mind isn't something 
that I would like very much 
and that's something that gets me very frustrated and when I'm in a bad state of mind here really bad head space I just start hating not even myself nicer hating my mind I use to think that hating your body more is worse than hating your mind now that he 
my mind so much like I realize that it pretty much really sucks 
you know you hear your body and everyone gets to see it everyone you can't just 
we can hide away inside but people can see your body but I hate my mind because the only people who can see it or you can try to even understand at the slightest as myself and I hate my line because I'm in love with things I shouldn't be I'm addicted to things that I shouldn't be Ahmed I'm addicted to hurting myself %HESITATION being self destructive whether it's quitting a job or smoking a cigarette or slicing my skin or not wanting to eat when I'm sad sleeping without a blanket when it's cold that's 
how you like to be self destructive 
taking a really fucking hot shower it's just how I wanna clean myself out basically it sucks that that's something that I actually enjoy doing and not something that I'm also addicted to another reason why I hate my mind is that I like the forbidden and by that I mean I like to be with people that I'm not supposed to be whether it's people who are double my age or people that my best friend had trouble with we're seeing Max's brother or having sex 
this is my last friends me knowing that it's forbidden and that even though I'm not in a relationship that is what I do and it's not I'm not using people like closely now 
I'm kind of backed myself up and say that I love that person by 
I'm not using people because I'm not in a relationship 
with them it's just that I am so I see the positive side in people I see the best in people so I logic in me meanest person you can think of and I will see them as a beautiful person just because I'm able to look through their flaws and what I see their flaws or I see something whether they're being mean or violent I 
see it as something way deeper that should be on over and the little clothes and other you know I hate my mind over analytical because I analyze silly things 
that's good to analyze things by analyze things too much and they start backfiring on the 
and Blair's always told me to stop analyzing things so much but I just I can't hope to do it analyze the way people carry themselves if they have their shoulders back or if there had high I idolized way people seek set analyze the way people move their eyes when they're eating whether they stare right at their food will keep their heads down or if they look around and it's 
frustrating because 
because of my fear which I talked about my video of forgetting things I'm constantly trying to remember all these things so all the data in my head is hurting up and hits 
close to take ticking it's because of constant taking and doesn't have a lot of food issues ever since I really fell into that community on Instagram I've never had a few dishes before that but I was I guess I was kind brainwashed into him so I'm constantly thinking when is the next time I'm going to be and when is the next time I'm going to have a drink and when I'm eating unlike ones next time I'm going to eat one of Michael next what have I even today was and of the day I'm lying in bed I'm thinking what I eat one day either one time you know what time that he was a portion to having leftovers and I try to think about all the nutrients had a fiver if I had enough protein and and the thing about it is I'm not even doing that because I want to be healthy 
pay my mind because I want to be healthy but I'm not doing anything about it paper money because the second I talked to my father I shut down this person Gillespie Hey how are you going my day was all good but when he talks to me I shut down press ahead of how you doing read how is your day that's good as much as I love him as as much as I love 
as was I love him as much as he loves me I can't help but shut down at something and I can't help 
to deal with like I can't help but love the for better and I can't help but feel the way I do that's what another reason why I hate my mind because I'm on unable to control a lot of the things I like the fact that I'm able to verbalize to be articulate 
speak eloquently about my feelings because I'm able to actually understand them more than a lot of people can but what I don't understand something I'm very confused 
about it and it frustrates me I get into a bad state of mind what I don't understand the way I'm feeling I'm feeling a sense of ambivalence which 
I want direct feeling I want to be able to put on paper and explain to someone that this is the way I feel but when I don't know the way I feel I get very frustrated I feel like I'm losing control when I feel like I'm losing control I self harm 
and I myself I feel bad because I feel like I'm losing control so that I saw her again 
and I feel bad because I feel like losing trust myself again 
unless cycle of this mind wanting to self destruct wanting to be in a different world and seen different dimensions I hate my mind because the second something goes wrong and something goes bad 
I mainly wanted to with my parents 
I visualize myself jumping out of a window 
you know that sounds really dramatic but I legit visualize myself 
I look out to window and I visualize myself jumping out of it it's the way I escaped I was 
sexually used 
without my permission first time I was on drugs and to 
release my mind from my body 
I 
turned my head while I was lying on the table and I looked out the window 
for the whole time it was happening I wasn't moving 
I looked out the window 
so now what's 
my way of Vic skating so every time something goes bad the first thing I think of how is 
jumping out of the window and that isn't even the way I want to kill myself have myself killed because it's not very pretty I hate that I want to live my life in a movie 
my mind once we live life like in the movie so I do is I believe a most unexpected multi 
it's only temporary person 
so really when everything's perfect everything's perfect 
and I forget about them so they don't bother me I don't stay with people to long term pre person I can draw people really fast if someone's being toxic to me even though I think that's friends with them for years I can drop very easily because there are several billion people out in the world I know I'm able to make friends from people person but it sucks because the longer you're with someone the longer they get to know you know they start to understand your mindset 
well they help you understand your mindset to 
to just talking to you 
and they analyze you too even when you what even the most introverts 
but we don't talk to us they do analyze you and you realize that they do but I just keep cutting them off because I'm afraid I hate my mind because I'm afraid of so many things and I'm afraid not being able to pre yet I keep 
okay afraid not gonna be able to live but I keep hurting myself Freida market have any money but I keep spending afraid I'm gonna lose all my friends but I keep 
her friends that all the people who support me 
not be here anymore 
but I keep pushing people away really sucks to be in my mind these think it sucks to be in my skin 
I so hate being in my skin and my body 
I always thought I could rely on my mind because I always thought my mind was at the 
thing fully realize that I only now did I realize 
how absolutely horrible it is to have a mind 
like mine and how much my mind just doesn't want to be with 
just lots 
me 
go away and I don't know where my mind will go
