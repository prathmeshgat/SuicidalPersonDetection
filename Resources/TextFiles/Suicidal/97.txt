one lykke li . what the fuck is on my eyebrows
Oh welcome to talking video on the first night forever so I went for the dark lip
today to a good-lookin dying i just tried on max lip pencil here in the good
old Khloe Kardashian how come home raised by the way this angle is really
weird because that is not gonna take it out because it took me like 20 minutes
put it on so so i wanted to talk about something much more serious i figured it
can help some people out there began suppressing I want to talk about give
you guys an update just basically what the title says but before I get started
on all three subjects i just wanted to say thank you so much for all of you
guys to support it means a lot to me because I could use more support you
know I don't have support from family and I wanted to address you know happy
elephant in the room in this case 3 and we share with you guys with three of
those things because you guys have helped me a lot and I think I owe it to
you guys too
why I've been a little bit off in the past year alright so let's get to it so
depression i know i made a video about depression anxiety and you know once you
have depression ye those chances you're going to be depressed again right so
like I said I know I was a little off for the past few months because i was
dealing with something that I didn't know how to handle and i want to cry
cause it's up to two hours to do myself have to myself but you don't this I
wasn't really myself in the past six months or so because I was just feeling
you know really lonely even if you're in a relationship with someone you still
can get really lonely and I don't talk about my relationships because i keep
that for myself and I usually vent to people but this is cheaper than therapy
that means yes i did fall back into depression stage where i wasn't i didn't
like myself for the longest time and I think I'd like myself and a lot of ways
whoa lashes hello my lectures just came up i'm sorry i'm gonna keep talking
cause I'm trying to keep it professional
anyways you know my grandma was the most positive person in my life she raised me
and i think i got my big heart from her because I don't think come from mama
today I don't dislike my moms don't pay by
I completely disrespecting her when I make fun of her we kind of have like a
mother/daughter like you know tit-for-tat we don't get a lot but we
can't choose our parents he now as you guys know my love the past and never
dealt with the death before especially if somebody who was so important to me I
think I was in denial for a while because I don't know how to deal with
death I think that massive loss just triggered my depression all over again
started to be really self-destructive now when i started to just jeopardized
everything that was important to me i began to lose interest in everything I
just didn't want to get better i just wasn't dealing with my emotions in a
healthy way you don't started drinking heavily and instead of drinking for joy
i abused it like I wasn't drinking to get drunk well obviously you're gonna
get drunk I just didn't want to feel you know alcohols a depressant so i just
made everything worse
I think a lot of that self-destructiveness I just let my
insecurities get the best of me and it consumed me know things just started to
go downhill
I told you guys in the past I was on medication for depression well that she
will just drive you even more depressed can rely on medication all that really
comes from inside so i went to that woman's retreat few months back
spiritual retreat so you do a lot of meditation and I was really hesitant to
go to that woman's retreat because i knew i had to confront a lot of ugliness
inside of me
nobody wants to confront the public when I went to the retreat there was a bunch
of women there who had much more bigger problems you need me and I just I think
wow like why am I being a selfish bitch to myself I punch myself because I
wasn't happy didn't know how to deal with my emotions
I started to have that fear where I don't stop doing what I'm doing I'm
going to
who's the most important person most important person that's in my life to
that depression just made me feel so ugly I lost touch of reality and when
you get into that dark place in your life it's scary i was holding in a lot
of anger and the only way I was gonna let that anger go it's not take it out
on somebody but yes i did happen a lot actually
so haven't come back from philippines just made me a different person
all over again you know just going to my grandmas grade so all this anger does
pent up inside of me i'll let go
why did you hang around a great but I mean I'm just saying it but the only way
that anger was going to keep me was to forgive the people that I was angry
about
so for those of you guys who are dealing with any of these three subjects you
have to know that it's a struggle but it's going to be okay i'm learning how
to deal with things rather than mask them just don't like your insecurities
get the best of you used to always get stressed out a lot for the simple shit
when I get stressed out eat everything I think this reason why gain weight not
just me anymore because I got a lot of negativity for not I don't care but you
know how cool kick somebody when you're down so and that pertains to everything
and everyone knows just all learning how to be a content person a much more home
and now whenever I feel like I just want to punch somebody I just look at my
labrador who read a little boy this is his head by the way for those guys
thinking what happened to my other dogs can only keep the dogs in my apartment
so the rest of them are at the beach house and you get playdates everyday
milkies kind of have like a little separation anxiety so he's weird that
makes the two of us with inside
actually I don't really get inside EA anymore entirety is a form of depression
so your locks are on point today my prices you know talk to somebody about
it or look at yourself in a different light you know life is really what you
make it and I've told you this in a past life gives you lemons make yourself a
lemon drops yeah i was just a little rant so you guys to see a serious side
of be if you guys being person actually very mature person like to think so
oh hey you see this powerful runner just double checked your book whole your
breasts
it burns the mustache off my face just remember guys everything's gonna be okay
think positively and in the beautiful words of NJ
