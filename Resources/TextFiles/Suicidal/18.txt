hi everyone I'm kind of too lazy to set up my camera somewhere pilot on some
books and shit but so just kind of balancing it so I'm sorry this is a
little bit wobbly there's this topic I kind of want to talk about and it's been
on my mind a lot
every time I make a video I trust think i'm going to title it and how I want to
stick to stick to the title you know make sure that whatever is on the title
is completely relatable nice i tend to sidetrack and go in different hands a
lot
so this is just me you know kind of trying i basically what about feeling
like an outcast in the family or I guess I feel like the ugly duckling this topic
really hurts me know like I can talk a lot about a lot of things I can casually
talk about myself farm but talking about my family is a very you know touchy
topic for me or at least you know and I guess it's such a personal issue i don't
really like other people getting into my family life
I'm because I love my family and I care so much about my family and I have great
parents
this is a disclaimer but I can't help but feel the way I feel and my rule in
life is no one should ever apologize for the way they feel because that is the
way they feel and they can't help but feel that way and I know I'm so ready to
get a lot of oh this is such a you know third world problems and stuff but like
i said i can't help the way I feel alright so first off when i was in
Australia I was living with my mother when I was around 7-8 that's when we
were kind of homeless and I was also with my brother wednesday i wasn't in
school and everything and my mother was having addiction issues and shit so it
was a really rough time for me
my dad was in Thailand with my stepmom I just refer to her as my mom when I talk
about my real mom I referred to her as my mother or my real mom
he was my stepmom and I would call him or he would call us and I'd be crying
and being like hey I'm so hungry
and i'm not in school and stuff and I just be crying and shit and he knew the
conditions we were in he talked to my mother and stuff and he knew the
conditions we were in and I can't help but resent him for not like just coming
to Australia and picking me up and picking me my brother up and I resent
him so much for that because he was always he was like my hero and when I
was in such a rough place like that completely blamed him i guess i should
have blamed my mother but I couldn't but he was like the protector and he didn't
protect me and it just ruined my view of him and it will always be like that you
know I respect him a lot is person I think he's a great person he might have
had his reasons but he doesn't really include a lot of those details but
anyways so then finally we got flight to thailand moved with my father and my mom
and I just refer to them as my parents
well we were there and it was good when we first went there and then we found
out that my mom was pregnant and I love my little brother he's awesome i 100%
respect to my mom because she was so young she took two children and when she
didn't even really know was and I mean yeah we went on holiday with her before
but she didn't know even how to feed us or how to dress us or what what we liked
and stuff so she was completely foreign to that she was never a mother so it was
a huge step that she took and I will always respect her for that but anyways
yeah we want would go on holidays together and i know this is one of the
third world problems kind of come up but yeah we took a lot of holidays together
and I remember when we moved to Malaysia after that was around nine and I was
like 10 miles time and my oldest sister came and then they went and then my
oldest sister my mom and my younger brother you know they went on holiday to
Bali without me and my older brother so you know my older brother okay with that
but it kind of like led to us feeling like we were kinda like burden because
we were born like our mother
my dad hates my mother and so it you automatically feel like a burden
you know because you're part of her and then we moved to taiwan you know i was
around 12 and we moved to taiwan when summer they were like oh we're not going
to go anywhere this summer but do you two want to go anywhere because we don't
have any money so you can just go somewhere and I was like oh that's
awesome
my parents are so sweet and I was like yeah i would like to go to Malaysia so i
could go visit my old friends and my brother said the same thing i'm going to
relate it so they want us to take a simulator I was so happy then they call
me and they're like hey we're in Finland and I was automatically really confused
i was like oh i thought you guys didn't have money obviously I didn't ask them
that I was like what are so I felt like they distracted does like dangled some
yarn in front of us and then like through it and then just went on their
own separate way and so they took my little brother with them you know the
love child spoiled child
the woman I'm kind of jealous of and they want to fill in and they want to
Sweden and it was just kind of like wow thanks for inviting me and my mean one
today so it kind of was shot in arm but I didn't really care i had a good time
in Malaysia but it's still stayed in the back of my mind and this is kind of like
a long story line that i have to kind of think of uh I didn't really mention that
I kind of have this energy for my mother because my dad would like he's head over
heels for her and I'm not envious that you know in that way but I mean like wow
that's truly I felt like he chose my stepmother over you know me my brother
so that like kind of hurt it was just kind of like thanks like you have
children dude
anyways they went on I mean I've been on holidays with them a lot i love me take
me on holidays but I don't like it when they just don't tell me you know a
couple months ago I come home from work and my my stepmom and my little brother
you know the lovechild you know there have they have luggage at the door and
I'm like what's going on where you guys going like oh we're going to Bali and
I'm like why are you like only telling me this like an hour before you go to
the airport and then like someone just looks at me and she
knows what I'm thinking and she's just like oh my grandmother died and I'm like
yeah but you didn't even tell me like you didn't even like wow i live in the
same house I don't even feel like I live in the same houses them you know sorry
I'm so sensitive like this building bothers me literally feel like an
outcast and then what really really hurt me was this like I'm going to actually
burst out crying I'm sorry guys but what really really hurt me because i'm sure a
lot of you guys can relate to me wait even for the smallest reasons you can
feel like a total ugly duckling in your family you know before I suicide attempt
I when I got you down my house and i'll say in other people's houses we had
plans to go to go home and the only time with me my dad we did not talk when I
was kicked out of my house at all
you text me like once in awhile and stuff but he texted me one time he's
like were buying the tickets to blow now are you still coming with us and I was
positive our relationship would get better so I said yes yes I want to go
with you to go home and I was happy that I said yes because I knew I would have
regretted and um my suicide attempt happen and I was George's my dad a lot
after my suicide attempt to just getting my health back and just getting some
positivity in my life and I'm like jogging with him and while we're talking
he's talking and stuff and he's like I think i mentioned wom or something and
he's like oh yeah he oh i have to mention that you're not coming two
kilometers like he said it like that and I like open my mouth and I just stopped
jogging and i turned to the side and I burst out crying because I was like
you're going to leave your suicidal teen a real alone on Christmas in a house
full of knives and razors and in a country full of drugs are you stupid
do you have hurt me so much it hurt me so much because because I just felt like
I was so unwanted
I was such a burden even after I was screaming for helping like hey fucking
pay attention to me i am ok just love me know and they were like oh you can't
come to go on with us and while i'm talking with him like I didn't want to
jog the rest so i just turned back after walking baggies are walking back with me
again saying to me he's like I'm so sorry and it wasn't even a I'm sorry
that you're so hurt right now
it was I'm sorry that I'm not reliable to you know how to get you a ticket and
that really really hurts it really hurts
yes I'm so ready for all the third world problems whatever that shit cry out for
attention but I can't help the way I feel and I'm sorry sir cruse when I cry
i'm so gross i cry okay anyways I'm not really quite a strong but a couple days
later he can't came up to me smiling and he's like we managed to get lou three
o'clock is ok we managed to get you the ticket and I was in like so happy I was
like jumping around I have such a great you know holiday with them it prob it
was probably my last holiday with them you know every holiday i go to I feel
loved but I always be like I'm kind of like a like a burden you know and i
forgot to mention that before that when my brother was here my older brother
from their plan to go to someone and my brother and i asked you both wanna come
and my brother said no and I said are we just going to fit month and they said
yes and I was like okay no because I don't want to just go to fit live in one
so many times but if it was any other country i would love to go and then so
they're like okay so they pay for the flights and everything and then I
realized that that was probably going to be the last holding a half of them so
what's my dad one night crying being like I really really do want to go like
i like i change my mind like I realized that this is this might be the last time
I'm going to spend time with you and he just said to me he's just like oh that's
a pity because i already paid for the
I its blood he's like oh and we're also going to germany and I was like I didn't
ask him but in my head I was like I asked you if we're gonna go anywhere
else because that would have changed my decision with going so I sound like a
fucking burden when they he managed to pay for my flight and pay for flight to
germany i felt like a fucking burden because I felt like I wasn't even
supposed to be on that trip and that I wasn't even supposed to be in Germany
with him you know when I was also you know like every time I go with them to
Finland and it's like a definite yes we don't go anywhere else we just go to
someone you know but whatever it alone and the planet just with their happy
little family where it's just my dad and he's loving wife and my younger brother
who I do love but he's very fucking spoiled
they then they go all all these different places and it hurts it hurts
just like feeling unwanted and even like anything this summer you know they all
right we're gonna go to Finland and I was just like okay this is my last month
the taiwan so i'm probably gonna stay here you guys are just going to stand
when Ryan they're like yeah because you know my oldest brother got married and
then they like text me two weeks ago they're like hey where this is a great
time we're in Norway and I'm like yeah I know I'm like thanks that's cool
happy for you guys I am happy for them but it's just kind of like I constantly
feel like I'm not welcome like my family's ashamed me because I'm me you
know and that's probably the worst feeling to ever have
I'm just feeling like you feeling like you're a part of something is probably
the best feeling to ever have you know even when it's like I remember when I
joined the school musical like play and at the end of the play
um it was such a lovely feeling because we were like a family and it was great
and when you actually are family and you go home to them every day and you just
don't feel like you're part of a family
it really hurts oh yeah state regarding my parents are amazing they're great
they're great people
they care a lot maybe they just put too much tension on other little things like
their reputation is and that's probably why they hate makeover on their
reputation for fucked publicizing my suicide attempt
note that i actually thought I was going to die so i don't really care
it hurts a lot because I don't feel like an outcast or ugly duckling I feel like
a fucking alien I feel like an alien to them and i'm sure a lot of people out
there feel the same way because it only took me awhile like it took me a really
long time to realize that this is the way I feel because I just kept sweeping
it under the rug and just hiding it behind the curtains and just being like
oh it's okay
they probably just forgot to mention it that you know they're going to another
country and all that stuff i just kind of like let it not hurt me but even side
of course it fucking hurt me and I'm pretty sure hurt my brother the same way
probably like my older brother so I like to watch my little three-person perfect
family which i'm not in I literally feel like I'm in a house you know where I'm
just renting out a room it's appreciated feeling feeling disconnected to other
people is where mental like our mental issues are from when we feel
disconnected to other people we act out in a different way because we want to
feel connected and when people see that were disconnected and they act
differently towards us that bothers us because all we want to do is feel mutual
with people as well a lot of you know mental problems are from and I could
talk about this forever but this is like a this is on a 20-minute video 20
minutes of me crying Wow
but therapy like I said every time I make a video it's like therapy so I'm
sorry i was looking at the viewfinder a lot it's just because like I'm care i'm
holding my camera in such a weird angle so I just kind of want to make sure that
like you know I'm not really wearing a lot
close i don't want to like / anyone or anything so thank you guys
no trauma code of the day kept them it's too sappy for it
okay bye
