ok so i don't really know how to start this video
it's going to be very different from the normal kinds of videos that i do and
that's because it's brutal and it's just me
one of one we have been completely bra and open and honest and transparent
I would be doing a huge disservice if I didn't use my ability to reach so many
people to talk about real issues and to make some sort of change or difference
so as hard as it is to do to sit here and talk about my own experiences and
feelings and my history and the things that a vote such heavy emotions and
feelings and memories
it's it's all worth it if I'm able to just help one other person I want to
convey real messages
I want to talk about real things and I want to be able to use the roots that I
have to impact people in a in a good way
so today I'm going to be talking about depression and my own history with it as
well
I and have managed to a comment and now i'm one of the happiest people that i
know so I don't want this video at all to be a stop story and I don't want
sympathy because of it and I don't want the attention at all
I just I'm literally only going to share with you as hard as it is to talk about
even though i'm now okay
it's still difficult to make out so I'm only sharing up with you in the hopes
that it would help at least one other person because if i am able to help just
one other person then it is entirely weapon so yeah let's do this
cart statistic is that a hundred and twenty 1 million people worldwide suffer
from depression and that's that's a really big number
depression is such a prevalent issue and I don't want to talk about materialistic
things like what i ate in the day or how to do my makeup routine or anything like
that i want to i want to talk about real messages and things that are going to
help and support people depression affect so many people and it's about
time that we start talking about it out loud and neutralizing the negative
stigma surrounding it's about time that we remove the embarrassment and shame
that comes along with it and I think it's about time that we accept that not
being okay it's okay it's okay to not be all right all the time it's alright to
need help and to ask for support
it's about letting people know that they're not alone because you you're not
alone
you are not alone if someone tells you that they think they're depressed
chances are they're not just asking for sympathy or they're not fishing for
compliments or they're not looking for attention as as much as it may seem like
they are if someone tells you that they are feeling depressed or down someone is
willing to tell you that and be honest with you
chances are that they are desperately seeking for support
take that as a compliment if anything that they are willing to confide in you
about something so serious and such a heavy issue in their life and if you are
able to provide them with the support or the cabin they need then please please
please please do not criticize them about coming to you with that
information don't judge them
just help them support them and if you can't support them
then help them to get the support that they actually do need help me to get
professional assistance and I am
a very bubbly happy vibrant or colorful person i suppose and and I am I am
nowadays I really am
except that wasn't always the case when i was 16 i ended up in the hospital a
few times in multiple different hospitals and psychiatric wards for
depression and attempted suicide
my parents have been together for 25 years my family's absolutely wonderful i
love my family so much I literally have nothing to complain about
in my life probably i have a good education I've always had a good hormone
in my head I've always had yummy delicious healthy balance through you
must help me
I've had good relationships I have nothing that is obviously wrong with my
life and nothing that I can that I ever have been able to complain about
and I still managed to get depression which is what seemed to make it worse
for me it was like I've been given every single blessing in this world and i
still couldn't be happy and thankful for that
it isn't a selfish thing being depressed isn't a choice isn't something that you
wake up and you go I'm going to be depressed because people are going to
care more about me
it's like you don't want them to care because you don't feel you deserve it
and it's like you don't you don't want to exist because you can't stand the way
that you feel you can't stand the sound of your breath you feel heavy and you
feel like you were a burden
- absolutely every person in your life you feel like you have nothing to offer
and I assure you that that is not the case
I show you that you are loved and that you are freaking beautiful and that you
have so much to offer and that just because you can't see that doesn't mean
it's not there
just because you think that you are flawed and that you're missing things
and that you are incapable or stupid or that you're told that you were those
things you aren't you r us so much more than what you even realize you're so
much stronger than you realize and brave I more
bridges and you have so much to give to other people that if you were to just
disappear you understand how many people would be impacted by that regardless of
the fact whether you can
whether you can even count them on one hand it's worth to stay there for just
those people even as one person if you are finding it that hard to stay alive
right now and 22 not attempt to kill yourself or that you were feeling that
there is no other way out
do it do it for your mom door for you sent off for your dog
just stay there for one more day for one other person do it for me do it for a
teacher or friend because you are so important so valuable to other people
and just because you can't see that doesn't mean that it that you are not as
hard and as far as the concept my same that you're going to be happy again one
day and that you're going to be able to remember what it feels like to be
genuinely happy and to smile and to love because being having depression let you
literally forget what it feels like to be happy
I i remember i had a conscious thought one day I was driving the car and I was
like I got my back
what happiness feels like i can't remember the last time that I genuinely
smiled and no one you that I was depressed
no one ever thought that I had a perfect life and that and then I was happy all
the time and looking at my life that would have appeared that way
the only thing that would have seemed like they could have been trying wrong
with me was my own insecurities and that's Colin for most teenage girls so
why would there be anything wrong with me
and that's that's what made it worse
the fact that I had every reason to be happy and I still felt unhappy i thought
i had no purpose
and when I tried thinking about the future
it scared me I was terrified because when I thought about it I would end up
in this circular ruminating thought it's like a big heavy shadow that
just follow you around and it will sit on you when you sit down and makes it
impossible to get up
it makes you look logic and tired and grab in movie but now i'm at the same
time it's like you you can't find any sort of passion and care you
you don't have anything you don't have any strong determination and makes the
active simply getting out of bed or breathing seemed like the most
impossible task in the whole world that makes same friends impossible because
you don't have the energy to you can't be bothered
and that's that's sounds so stupid because it's like if you're upset
you need your friends why would you not want to see them and it sometimes like
if it gets bad enough it's like you don't think that you deserve their care
well maybe they have their own problems and they don't care about yours or that
that you don't want them to care about yours
because somehow deep down depression becomes your friend and you can find in
a 10 minutes
it's a way of escaping reality
I used to I used to sleep for up to like 12 to 16 hours a day just because to me
it was a way of escaping reality and it meant that if i was asleep
I don't have to feel i remember i became so upset at one point that I tried to
kill myself I remember I was convulsing on the ground and I remember just
thinking like make it stop make it stop
and I wasn't talking about the convulsions I was talking about my
breath about my life
it was that I couldn't stand feeling the way that I was and that seemed like the
absolute only escape and it wasn't it
absolutely wasn't and I wish I knew that at the time I wish I going to someone
and ask for help or support because at the time I I didn't feel like it when I
understand and I didn't feel like anyone would care or if they did care that they
shouldn't that I wasn't worthy or deserving of their love that I was
inadequate
I used to repeat to myself that I was pathetic and worthless and useless and
those three things over there about your pathetic worthless useless
dad saying about 20 different doctors psychiatrists psychologists
hypnotherapist even the only time i actually started to get better I was
when I decided within myself that I didn't want to feel that way anymore and
that I didn't have to because killing myself wasn't the only way out
and after seeing the way that my family was impacted of felt after they thought
they were going to lose me
was it something that I'm never going to forget and and I couldn't possibly ever
do that to them again because you mean so much to the people in your life that
you can understand that
who's been losing you is the single worst thing I remember being in the
psychiatric ward for up I think it was a month or so afterwards and as an
inpatient which meant that i slept there stay there and they felt that it was
essential that i was watch 24 7 I remember my brother is coming to see me
one of the first days that i was in there and I had a really good
relationship with both of my brothers when I was younger but then from the age
of black five until 15 or 16 when I was in the hospital and the middle brother
and I want very close the door we actually what kind of worst enemies and
always speak to each other and I remember him coming in and cry and hug
me and I
that was one of the biggest enemy quite for me and that's broke down because it
was exactly what I needed
and until then I never realized just how important i was 21
Emily like I said it's not going to be quick it's not going to be instant it
will be first thing about recognizing the small things about trying you know
about trying new things trying to meet your people and it's daunting is that
may be a promise you it is not as bad as you think it's going to be it is not it
is not going in reality to be as bad as you had made it up in your head to be so
do those things challenge yourself as hard as it's SS seems to do to even
breathe or move
I promise you it will be worth it and that one day you will feel happy again
and that you will find yourself laughing and enjoying moments with your friends
or your family or even by yourself you will be able to empathize with other
people about it and hopefully help others and support them through their
own challenges
except you will be able to see it from an outsider's perspective and remember
that you felt these things but no longer feel them I no longer have them as a
detrimental impact in your life and it's not going to influence you in such a way
that it's it's horrible to live and it's horrible to wake up this is really hard
now i know that it wasn't it it wasn't a reason that I was unhappy i had clinical
depression which which means that it's not circumstantial it doesn't depend on
my situation of the seasons and that's when your body doesn't produce enough
serotonin for you to feel the way that you should
so it's it's richly just chemicals and hormones that are misplaced or violence
or your your brain and body just isn't making enough so it's easy to treat
and it's just simply about understanding that that is why you feel the way you do
and there is a treatment for it and it's not going to go on forever
it's ok if you need medication I really hope that you don't ever have to go
through that
but if you do if it's not going to be forever and it doesn't have to be
forever and I'm now living proof that you can get through it
I
I thought there was absolutely no other way I thought that ending my life was
the only way to make the feelings go away and it's not it's absolutely not
as soon as I was prepared to go and ask people for help and I was prepared to
accept the support that was given to me
I began to see improvement and I was an instant it wasn't like it wasn't like a
switch was flipped and I instantly but I'm not
it took a lot of time and it took energy and effort but it is starting with that
life is worth it
it's even just the the future we shall slow lane but it's like the not knowing
what lies ahead
the fact that there could be so many incredible people and things and
cultures and foods and places that you experience that you don't know of yet
it's like there is that much out there that if you want and you're like them
completely missing out on that and why would you want to do that why would you
don't you want to know what's out that doesn't the mystery of life intrigue you
enough to hold on for another day but if you are living with depression and that
is how it feels for you then you need to understand that you are already the
strongest thing in the whole world
waking up and getting through a day just another day
leaving with the thought that you want to kill yourself and that you are not
worthy is the hardest thing you will ever do
and you've been doing it every single day which makes you the strongest most
courageous human they possibly could be
so you're not weak and you're not you know it lacks strike and you're not
it's not that you're not courageous or that you're not worthy of that you're
pathetic or worth also useless
it's the complete opposite is that because you were capable of feeling
those extreme dark thoughts you are also capable of feeling the most extreme
happiness and joy and passion because you can feel those extreme illusions
it also means that you're capable of feeling the most extreme pleasures that
has been the biggest gift it's like getting through something that i didn't
think i could get through has led to something so much better
and I know I a pinky pinky promise you that you can do the same
I promise you that you can get through this and that you will get through it
and if you need support then asked for it do not be ashamed or embarrassed
because there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about
if you need help that is okay it is okay not to be okay
all of the time my life now seems completely happy and full of color and
adventure and and it is except that doesn't mean that it's always rainbows
and smiles and sunshine
I mean I try my absolute best to surround myself with things that that
helped make me feel positive and happy and to do the things that i love and to
be the people that I love but that doesn't mean that that's all there is to
my life
I mean feeling down is I'm feeling upset and guilty or I guess I'm regretful is a
completely healthy and normal part of living it's you
you have to be able to feel those to be able to feel happy also because if you
don't
how are you supposed to know what the other one feels like feeling unhappy
occasionally is good and it means that when you feel happy to make it feel so
much better
so you can or you shouldn't diagnose yourself or anyone else with depression
at something that only a doctor should be able to diagnose
however if you do have any symptoms of depression then i do recommend that you
do go and see a doctor just to see just to get their opinion
so things like fatigue empty num sad
Terry angry irritable on edge moody any news
thoughts beliefs especially about yourself or your attitude maybe even
three current thoughts about death or diet loss of interest in friends and
activities
if you're finding it hard to remember things are you having like a clouded
mind or your zoning out a lot
finding it hard to concentrate sleeping too much or not enough
anything that feels abnormal and for an extended or prolonged period of time
just going to see your doctor case if it is depression they will be a diagnosed
with that and be able to provide you with any kind of support that you need
to pressure isn't something that you choose at something based on a your
chemical hormone imbalance that could be genetic it could have to do with the
situations in your life
it could be caused by a medical condition or disability chronic pain
stress abuse bullying any kind of traumatic event if you feel that you may
have depression or someone close to you has depression
please talk about please just talk to someone asked to support provide support
be shoulder to cry on cry on someone's shoulder whatever you feel like you need
it's okay it is a illness that can affect your body mind and soul and it's
a serious illness that doesn't discriminate
so it doesn't care what background you have what kind of skin you have a clock
here you have it affects people of all genders cultures stages of life it
doesn't discriminate
depending on your background or your values or what you had for breakfast
even the people who treat depression can have depression
yes I was prescribed antidepressants but i also started to consciously make
changes in my life that would help me to feel happy again to be able to remember
what living life probably actually felt like a mint
so I'm looking for just little things that make me feel happy things like
firstly worksheets and the way that a feeling your skin or seeing little
people laugh or going to the beach and just smelling the fresh salty
diving beneath the way you're going for a bike ride for the win Hell the Sun on
your shoulders or just going for a run in general as hard as it is to get
yourself out and moving you feel so much better when you do I promise you go for
a walk take some pictures to poke your dog outside going to have a conversation
with a stranger gonna have a conversation with your name out with
your friends with a parent or loved one
read a book write a book force yourself to get out of bed force yourself to
smile as hard as that is focus on the little things
find what makes you happy and do it find the things that bring me joy and
surround yourself with though
surround yourself with people that make you feel happy with the things that give
you purpose enjoy feel your life we think that you're passionate about
because passion is purpose just be generally kind of people work on leaving
a legacy behind that you were proud of work on being remembered as the kind of
person who is able to make a difference and not on your life but other people's
life work on being the kind of person who you would be happy to meet and who
you up but happy to be remembered as you are actually going to be afraid of death
one day you're not going to want to die
it came at a time in my life that most teenagers especially girls find really
hard to kind of time where you search things that give you purpose because
you're not exactly sure what defines you I search for purpose in all the wrong
places
so I started altering things about myself that I thought we've potentially
bring me a sense of purpose of fulfillment by veganism i5 Buddhism
I felt like I need to escape
so I felt like travel would be a good thing so I dropped of travel and I had
the biggest one the last because I thought that if I could just get away to
someplace beautiful like all the things on the internet tell you I just need
some time in a beautiful place to clean mine it's ok that is to feel it's not
necessarily the answer because for me I was the problem
escaping wasn't even an option because the problem with my head and running
away wasn't going to fix that and so when i do try to escape and like travel
or something
that every time I want to wait when you place I thought I would find happiness
and I would become a different person and I would seek the things that I was
looking for
i I didn't find them under find the fulfillment because the problem wasn't
the place that I was in all the friends that was surrounding me and was the
chemicals in my in my brain and I the deal didn't have I now realize that as
shaping wasn't the answer whether it be running away or going someone you or
seeking approval from your kind of people that's not the answer the answer
isn't isn't in anyone else's eyes are different places within yourself and
it's about being a cake that and being content with the fact that you don't
need to place anyone except for you
I got into yah i started using meditation as a form of therapy use
using creativity is there a sort of drawing and writing and expressing
emotions that I've had and I found that really beneficial and i still find that
useful so I still do that
I still express myself through words I'm through our and photography because
that's something that makes me feel better and getting it out of your body
and into a physical form help so much
I'm not saying that works for everyone but if it does work for you then do it
find what makes you happy and what makes you feel better and do that
even things as simple as treating your body right so eating a healthy balanced
diet drinking enough water doing things that spiritually are enlightening or
that bring joy and happiness things that emotionally bringing stability and
comfort
it's about surrounding yourself with that the people that make you feel good
and the people that need you as well because it's not just about needing
other people all the time
it's also about being that person for others exercise exercising so important
as it releases endorphins endorphins make you feel good
legally blonde and she's like excess bring to endorphins and endorphins make
you happy
have you been able to don't you have that they just don't know it sounds so
simple and that's because it is
really is that simple just about doing the things that you love and surrounding
yourself with people and things that make you feel joy and to make joy is the
feeling of green on the inside so it's things that make you feel alive
I'm sorry that this is being a much longer video that I had anticipated and
that I broke down a few times because it was actually a lot harder than I thought
I sincerely apologize for that but it has actually made me realize as well
just how much I've grown and how much I'm going to continue to grow and how
much I want to get up and help others to be able to feel and do the exact same
thing and I know that there's probably a thousand things that I've forgotten to
mention in this video because there's this so much to it and there's so many
things that go through your mind
I forget anything i'm going to put it down in the comments below I guess
information i need to put it out there that if you or someone you know is
suffering depression or you think might be suffering depression
please just do not criticize and judge ok it's not their fault they're not
intentionally doing that you're feeling those things it's an illness and it
should be treated in such a way and I'm hoping this video and someone will
actually will actually help to reduce the negative social stigma surrounding
it and surrounding talking about and verbalizing these emotions because they
are so common and if you have depression you are not alone i promise you you are
not alone
there's organizations and even like helpline numbers that you can call and
talk to people even is anonymous so that you don't have to feel ashamed or
embarrassed about it many who you are and they can give you the government for
that you need so it going to adopt out or call one of the numbers below or
there's multiple websites i put those in the caption as well
it's just about finding a source that you're ok with being open and
with because ultimately that's the only thing that's going to help you is a
meeting that one you feel that way and to that you want help and you start
slowly and gradually feeling better and just start smiling again and you'll
start remembering what it feels like to feel joy and happiness
I wake up excited now I wake up looking forward to the sunshine and looking
forward to what lies ahead and the mystery of other day like stupid as that
sounds I i love it i love waking up and not knowing what lies ahead because that
excites that's that's what i want to do with this channel and with the voice
that I now have to root so many people on social media is that I want to help
them and i want to show you the happiness but you can feel too and the
beauty that the world has and that's I'm hoping is what I'm conveying through my
social media channels my ending videos because i'm going to have to do it so
I'm ready for that all right anything except that's that's pretty much what i
wanted to talk about and I just
I'm hoping that that me being this vulnerable and transparent with you
willing some my help at least one person
