hi everyone um I just want everyone to know that I'm okay and that I'm just um
no I didn't read all the support i'm getting from my side Instagram
delusional and also my snapchat and my Twitter and i'm reading all of them and
I'm okay and I'm just taking some time off and just taking some time to breathe
and that it doesn't matter whatever happens I'm always going to be okay and
that's the fact about it and every bit of support that i'm getting is amazing
and for anyone who doesn't know what's going on
there's pretty much nothing that's going on it's just my brain that's going on
and it's driving me insane and and cigarettes out and all i want to do is
just be in my house with my mom be with my family which are back home and try
one
that's all I want to do and I'm too fucking sick too fucking sick of the
world
I'm so fucking that that half the world is hungry because half the world has
never had to sleep with an empty stomach
I'm so sad that we have enough money to feed the whole world yet had some hope
is fucking hungry and I'm so fucking that that people are mean that people
don't give a fuck
and if people aren't mean to me but I hate seeing people being mean to other
people and it sucks when you want to change the whole world but you can't
because you just one person and I just want to save everyone
and sometimes
all the universe all the universes positivity is coming into me and I'm
just handing it out to everyone else
no I'm not keeping any for myself and I really should but if I could save other
people i rather save them to myself how can I save other people when i'm not
even alive and like I wish I just wish this brain could stop wanting to hurt
myself and I just wish that I could finally find a way to carry myself and
like the fucking journey and I'm trying I'm trying so fucking hard and it sucks
because I'm trying to be a good person and I kill people with kindness and I
just I just want I just want the best for everyone
I want everyone to be happy and it sucks because sometimes i put people in front
of me
I put people before me and the broke best relationship you can ever have is
with yourself and still and still working on that and I'm trying I'm
trying so forth nord and I appreciate everybody's support that I'm getting but
something's fucking triggering me and I don't know what it is and I think it's
just it's just that it doesn't matter and just that whether I'm here or not
yes i will continue to shine and the grass will continue to grow the birds
will sing trees will grow and people live and the world will continue its
cycle and I would just be another person in history
no one will remember but I don't this is so depressing and I don't want to press
people
it's just fucking 6am thoughts and I can't sleep properly because you can
sleep when when your brain is constantly taking and and we're just going fucking
insane
I'm going fucking insane
thank you everyone for the support i'll be back up and please check my d pop
store because i need to make money so I can pay rent and I can help my mom out
because my mom's not doing too well and I'll over two dozen and it sucks and it
hurts because I want to do is treat her like a princess
that's why it and that's why I try to help her as much as I can and it sucks
because I want to help myself and I want to live my own life but I just I just
have this con is just constantly want to help other people and I'm just pulling
all my effort into other people and I just need to put some effort into myself
and and buck like it really sucks
I hope everyone's having a really good day
so what better than mine oh but either way I'm going to be okay kids
we're all fucking fighters and you are doing
don't ever feel the way that I do they still never beat yourself up
please never hate yourself to keep yourself together
keep yourself alive do whatever the fuck you can do whatever the fuck you can
stay life
