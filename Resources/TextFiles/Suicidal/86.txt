there's no easy way to start this
hey guys so I'm not going to talk about my previous videos were past that it
happened
you know we all have opinions you need to discuss some of the other videos
trying to bring down here on today we're going to talk about is after i posted
these videos I realized something i haven't quite shared much of my past
with you guys
I've told you guys a lot about what I'm doing now and how does that apply to do
but i'll remember earlier on I told you that eventually I tell you some more
about my past because I just wasn't quite comfortable on youtube yet
that's the part that I definitely was not ready to share until now
so this is the real part of my coming out story
a lot of people focus on other people's reactions when you're coming out they
focus on whether you will accept or reject you and how that all goes down
and I understand that's a very it's a very big part it's basically like the
entire part that you understand is coming out because you have to tell the
entire world that you know you're gay and that some people don't like that and
that the rejection can be horrible and people can do crazy things and you can
get bullied or harassed and all that stuff and on because I act the way I do
on because i'm not as flamboyant as a member of the community a lot of people
don't think that I understand the hardships that our people went through
when they were coming out
but what a lot of who don't know if we all go through the same emotional
changes for coming out and I think I went through more emotional changes in
this part of my life
then I have with anything else when I was in the seventh grade I started
noticing guys I started thinking about them in ways that I thought I shouldn't
have and I didn't really have any interest in girls
so I thought that was wrong of course and i know i said that like I pushed it
back and like a held and I didn't want to think about it and I waited till I
was in high school I actually like accept it and come out but that's not
the whole story behind it when I was in seventh graders are having these
thoughts and these thoughts continue to progress
I know how much i repressed them and held him back I didn't like them
um I started to get depressed I started to think that there is not
I could do and that if I thought this way that bad things are gonna happen to
me and not only where bad things going to happen to me but that i would hate
myself because I was thinking the way that I did people were gonna hate me
my family was going to love me and most importantly I wasn't going to love
myself because I was disgusting
um I was raised thinking that it was not normal were right
my family is totally accepting of it but the fact is at the time I didn't know
what to do
I was scared as hell so that depressed i started skipping school
um I remember there was one week where I spent the entire week I'd skip school I
wake up in the morning and tell my mom I was sick I tell my mom that I something
was wrong and I couldn't go to school because I just felt so horrible and she
didn't know quite always up then
and so she just kind of like you know gave me my space let me do it
and at this point is the first time in my life where I had suicidal thoughts on
now you might understand why I was a little on if you are sharing this
um I didn't think that I could go on feeling the way that I did I didn't
think that I could go on feeling the way about myself that I did I didn't like
myself
I didn't like the way that I thought I didn't like the way that I felt I didn't
like having to keep myself in in fear of what would happen to me and so I thought
if I just ended it now
nothing could have nothing worse could happen you know it would all be over
one and done and that would be yet and so I did that and I remember one on the
friday of that week my mom came home from work early and she sat down and she
was like what's wrong
and so I just I didn't tell you that I was gay at this point I didn't know what
to say to her because my mom had told me about some people that she knew that it
had the same kind of parts as me and
she told me what they went through and the things that they had to deal with
and she told me that we were in a spot we were in a rough spot at this point my
parents had divorced
I was my mom raising three boys she was working two or three jobs at the time
things were tight things are stressful on top of my sexuality coming out in the
middle of it for me
so besides that she had some other reasons to think that I would have these
thoughts
so she gave me all that reassurance that i needed she told me things will be fine
we're going to work through this that we would be together as a family that there
is no way that anything that would happen because we were a family and we
we had made it through worse and so we can make it through this and so with my
mom's reassurance i was able to get back to school get out with my friends you
know make myself happy for the next couple years and like as these thoughts
continue to come to me
I just kind of thought you know it's okay like it we find they'll go away
like it's probably just a phase like a lot of people say I'll be okay
oh and deep down I knew that wasn't really going to be the case but on the
surface for then it was enough for me
so fast forward eight grade I thought those things
ninth grade I thought those things sophomore year hit in the high school
and that is when the rumors rumors started my freshman year and I just
ignore them but they got really bad my sophomore year people started saying
that I was gay because I didn't have a girlfriend because I hung out all these
really beautiful girls and stuff so they really thought that I was gay
just because they did and somebody said it just kind of hit cap like wildfire
and so on
once again like these thoughts starting to get to me they started to hit me deep
inside because I thought that I could like get rid of these feelings than that
everything be okay because eventually I would just grow out of it and so out
this is at that time when I was kind of starting to accept myself as for who I
was just later on in my sophomore year but when these rumors started and people
started asking me and then some people started saying that I told them are
I once again i got to press I started thinking these things I started feeling
bad about myself
I started thinking that these rumors were horrible that if this is the way
people were reacting about rumors how they can react and I actually came out
and i really got upset and that's when the thoughts came back again
I thought if I kill myself now I can avoid all this trouble
it's the easiest way out hey I can do this
like there's no way that I shouldn't skip some more school
I stayed home alone a lot I didn't go out my friends as much at this time and
at this point i was messaging my friend Breanna online she moved away after our
eighth grade year of middle school and she moved to Florida and we kept in
touch we still keep in touch today and i was messaging her and I was telling her
that i have these thoughts and I she was the first person that I told that I
thought I was gay I am I say like my friend mallory the first one that I
physically came out to but my friend Breanna is the first one that I told
about me having thoughts about being gay and she was the most supportive person
but when I told her that I was having these thoughts and that I just I
couldn't go on
I didn't really know what to do with myself because I didn't feel comfortable
talking about this with anyone as I was so scared and I was scared of how people
react and I was scared myself
I didn't want to do anything to hurt myself but I also didn't know that I
could keep going on like this
I couldn't guarantee that i wasn't going to do anything to myself she kept
reassuring me and telling me that she loved me no matter what and that
everything is gonna be okay because everybody would love me and if not she
would always just say screw them because they don't even matter
and so she really got me through it and on the nut I remember one night and
called her on the phone
and we were talking and I was crying because I was scared I was scared that
one of these days I would just snap losing my mind just end it
it would just be horrible i'm not making this up this was a time I know I seem
like completely like no an emotional about it but it's because I'm past that
time in my life I have made through the rough waters and I am totally over it
now
it was scary it was horrifying
so I was talking to on the phone that night and she was telling me all this
stuff and she was saying how everything was going to end up being fine because
being gay was just becoming a normal thing so if I was gay or maybe I wasn't
gay
if I chose to accept this is who I was I would be all right and it meant a lot
coming from her
it really means a lot when you have the support of like your closest friends on
the issue especially like through the internet
I'm so grateful for the internet because it's it's how I share this stuff with
you guys it's how i get to connect with people all over the world back then
that's how I was able to accept who I was
so we were talking on the phone and that night she made me promise that I would
never act on those thoughts and I did and I take promises very seriously a
broken one promise and my entire life and so I t promises extremely seriously
and so she didn't want me to hurt myself and I didn't want to hurt her through
hurting myself so I promised you that I would never act on these thoughts and if
they came up again I will shoot her a message to give her a phone call and we
talked through it and that's what I did when I have these thoughts or when I
thought about these things and maybe I felt like I needed to act a certain way
I super shooter a message give her a phone call
little do people know that's where this little bugger right here on my wrist
comes from have faith in three birds
have faith that where you were got you where you are and where you are is going
to get you where you're going
past present and future three birds have faith in yourself
things will get better this tattoo was spawned on that night
that is where the idea for this came from
I knew as soon as I turned 18 I would get a reminder to myself of that promise
and yes this tattoo means a lot more than just that promise but i would not
have it where I have it so I see it every single day this one on my wrist is
a promise for me not to kill myself
I know that sounds like a serious claim and something we're going to be like
whoa that came out of nowhere but it's the truth
that's what I went through a lot of people like to say that I might not have
gone through as much because of the way I act the way I present myself
you're wrong we all go through the same struggles more coming out some of us
face more rejection from other people but some of us also faced more rejection
from ourselves and I think that can be more dangerous than facing external
destruction and rejection
so if you are having problems accepting yourself for who you are
I know what you're going through I know it can be scary and I know it can be
tough
just remember have faith things will get better and you'll learn to love yourself
if you need someone to talk to
shoot me a message saying something in the comments maybe you can message me on
twitter instagram send me an email to my business email sent me a message here on
youtube I don't care how you try to communicate with me
just communicate with me because I know it's hard sometimes you just need
someone to talk to
I don't she has to know that I'm here for every single one of you always so
glad I got that off my chest this is where i went to middle school
this is what I went through in high school and the kind of behind the scenes
of my coming out story
I didn't face as much rejection and some people did from everyone else
I just faced a lot of rejection and hurt from myself
it's rough but I made it through it and i'm here today and I stand taller
because of it
I love myself more because of it I respect myself more because of it
so remember you can make it do anything you guys like this video give it a big
