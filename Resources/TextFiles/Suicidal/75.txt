hey guys all right off the bat get your tea ready
this is going to be kind of like a sit-down oh my god need to get my
emotions in check
this video's something that it's really hard for me to film because I'm the kind
of person that when i talk about things I kind of relive them and my whole life
i have always been like a super super emotional person but um I have some
other things that have to film today for you guys
oh my god my series where where's my tissue already lost my tissue damn i'm
serious with it right now like I'm serious um ok i'm sure i'm like scaring
a bunch of you guys um ok
basically what we're going to talk about in today's video is my experience with
depression and like I was trying to say i have a couple other things that arm i
want to film for you guys today and I sat down and I was about to just jump
into it and I was like you know what my channel I pride myself one hundred
percent on being very very real on my channel I don't sugarcoat things
um I don't want you guys to think that my life is all perfect and that i'm
always happy all the time and that i love this fabulous amazing life because
in all reality I think that a lot of youtubers do kinda portray that image
not knocking them or anything you know if you think about it your Instagram is
like your highlight reel
you know it same thing with YouTube we're not going to film like the moments
were really down and um you know not proud of our struggles that we're going
through but we do filme a lot of like happy times in our life into a lot of
times it can come across as you know that we live these happy perfect life
ok my nose needs to stop trippin i need to get my life together
hold on so instead of jumping into those videos today I was like you know what I
need to sit down with my subscribers and tell them what's been going on
I feel that my story is so important
Rocco you want to sit on my lab I feel that my story is so so important because
what I went through and what I'm still going through is something that there's
one little concept that if I
share this with somebody that's going through the same thing then even if it's
just one person it is so worth it for me to come out with this video so I want to
start off this whole story with you guys i'm back to when i started not really
feeling like myself and I know that it's very normal to kind of get grumpy here
and there or stress or annoyed or kind of a little bit of anxiety that's a
normal feeling that human being will feel but the way that I started feeling
was on another level and i have to tell you guys that I look at clinical
depression completely different now that's something I'm going to get into
in a second
um but it was actually back when I had my cancer scare and I had to get a
biopsy done on my breasts which I shared here in my channel because I share
everything with you guys and I noticed that after i got the news that
everything was okay and that it was benign
there's no cancer I just was not celebrating enough like I felt like I
had gotten into such a funk waiting for the results that even when I got the
news that everything was okay that I still I felt miserable i felt like the
news wasn't okay I felt no drive for life
um so I basically I tried to ignore it and I tried to film and I tried to just
stay in good spirits I'm telling myself me you just got amazing news you had a
cancer scare
and now everything is okay why aren't you like happy and filming and on your
game and i kinda just fell back a little bit from youtube and i started getting a
lot of messages from you guys saying oh so you're just going to upload one time
a week now where are you you're not on Instagram on Facebook you're not
definitely not on your YouTube channel where are you and I kind of just
disappeared because i just fell into such a funk so it's happened to me my
past before I kind of you know kind of compare it to having a writer's block
like as a youtuber you have to keep up with constant material and sometimes
will feel like okay I've done it already
so what I felt like that in the past I've been doing this for like five years
now so in the past when I felt like this I just gave myself like
one or two day break away from YouTube away from social media and I want to
come back i'm normally ready to pick up where I left off
ok this lasted a really long time so was already maybe halfway into the month
into februari and I just I I don't know how to explain it to you guys other than
I didn't feel like myself so I prepared to go see a psychologist because i knew
that i just wasn't myself and I want to share with you guys the note that i
wrote down in my phone because I wanted to have everything in a list so that
when i went to go see the doctor that I was going to be able able to explain
everything that I was feeling so it's really hard for me to read this because
it brings me back to this moment and i wrote this on
februari 222nd which was the day before I had a doctor's appointment so I'm
basically the feelings that I was feeling was an extreme overall feeling
of sadness no excitement for life horrible feeling in my gut and extreme
panic and anxiety very antisocial overanalyze everything and overthink
everything
quick to react with aggression extremely emotional insensitive no longer in
control of my thoughts or my mood no longer feeling like a happy person
overwhelmed with life and it's the absolute worst when I'm alone and I'm
like freaking out in my head because I've never had this feeling before i
literally would want to wake up every single day and just lay in bed I didn't
want to film I didn't want to keep up with comments I didn't want to plan
future videos I didn't want to see my friends I didn't want to see my family
um I kind of just over night became a different person and when it first
happened I'm like okay i'll get over its a funk but it kind of was getting
progressively worse and it scared the shit out of me because I'm like this is
not me
why do I not even want to like get up and get dressed and put my makeup on you
know you on weekends during the week it didn't matter
I just didn't feel basically like I want to live anymore and I know it's crazy
say that I wasn't suicidal but um I just really lost my passion for life and I
want that you guys appreciate that i'm being like so candid about this because
it's definitely hard for me to speak about and put it on internet for people
to see but if anybody else in the world feels like this I feel you like I look
at depression so fucking differently now
sorry for cursing I'm okay so here's a key . what i want to tell you guys I
want to go see a psychologist and um I spoke to him about all my symptoms and
he decided to put me on an antidepressant medication that my sister
is also on my younger sister Melanie and she's been on it um I want to say about
3-4 years to have tissue on my face I feel like I feel the tissue on my face
ok so Jesus Christ them such a wreck in this video so Melanie my younger sister
used to have a really bad OCD and anxiety when we were in high school so
she went on lexapro which is the antidepressant and a couple other things
that she's on so I want to go see her doctor and he said that kind of it runs
in the family if somebody had a good experience with an antidepressant
chances are you'll have a good experience with it to instead of just
starting with any random antidepressant so he put me on lexapro and he did say
that it could take 6-8 weeks before helps my mood or you know all the
symptoms the anxiety the depression panic disorder the OCD all that stuff so
um my room was on februari 23rd where the very beginning of market has not
been six to eight weeks just yet but uh I do feel like the medicine is helping
with certain things i will do a video on that if you guys want because I know a
lot of people are against medication me personally actually being one of them
that lets you guys know that how I felt like it was my absolute last resort I
felt like there was nothing else left to do i join some yoga and then
station and taichi place and I pray a lot and I do a lot of other things to
kind of help handle my stress but I knew that my something was wrong with my
mentality and I really don't want to be on medication because you know before i
turn 30 and 20 i just turned 28 in February which was a horrible horrible
birthday month but anyway that's neither here nor there
um I want to have kids and I don't want to be hooked on medication and also
don't want to rely on medication to make me happy but I do feel like this might
be just a way to help me transition over this period where my brain kind of
freaked out and okay so I'm losing my train of thought here so I don't plan on
being on the medication for the rest of my life but I do want to give it like
six months to just let it work in my system and pretty much just reset my way
of thinking which the doctor said it could work for that not everybody has to
be on a long-term so um after that appointment I was like okay you know i
hope that this stuff works the next two days i was feeling like crap third day I
was feeling like crap
it makes you sick the pill makes you very sick to your stomach so I have been
throwing up and other unmentionables that were unmentionables
we're not gonna talk about let's just have been in the bathroom a lot so I was
like you know still pretty miserable and then something just hit me when I was
like when let me sit down and think what the hell i started feeling like this so
I sat down and I noticed i sort of you guys
it was like something just came over me where I was like new birth control pills
I've been on new birth control pills and that is when all these symptoms started
so i looked up online i pulled up the website i am going to let you guys know
the name of the birth control pill because i think it's very important and
I don't care if the brain thinks this is bashing this is my personal story on
this fucking pill and you guys stay away so the name of the pill is loestrin 24
fe so I went on the on their website and i love that the okay hold on hold on let
me I gotta pee myself up this is gross
ok
ok so love story short i went on the low estrogen website and I kind of was
looking at the statistics of the side effects and it said that the risk for
depression or anxiety was very low but that if it did happen in people that it
was a severe depression very little people it happened to but if it did
happen to you it was a really severe case so I was like okay not have a phone
call sorry I have to go you back okay so then I want on this Web cut on this
website i found it not sponsored at all application calm and I was shocked by
how many people experience the same exact things that i have almost all caps
people are writing side effects high anxiety depression acne and I was
getting a couple spots here and there this girl I've always had anxiety but it
was to a tolerable extent this birth control greatly exacerbated my anxiety
and caused me to even seek out a therapist because of it i would not
recommend taking this birth control if you are already prone to anxiety or
depression or have dealt with it in the past
ok here's another person that says suicidal thoughts anxiety depression all
the lovely mental health side effects which also want along with cystic acne
and migraine i'm normally a very bubbly person I can't believe me I can't
believe it took me this long to realize it was the birth control that was doing
this to me
horrible it also affected my relationship since I have anxiety and
freaked out on him for no reason
here's another one I became in all caps a complete emotional mess this is my
first time being on birth control I was nervous to go on it because normally I
hate taking medication and i was told that it's a low dose pill so that I
wasn't going to have much side effects wrong in all caps
I'm normally a happy secure confident and not easily offended person but this
will turn me into a complete wreck
now I cry at the drop of a hat pretty much every night and sometimes multiple
times a day over minor things I got offended at pretty much everything
my boyfriend and I used to be able to joke around and be silly but now he'll
say things jokingly and i'll be pissed for hours
I'm exhausted all the time I have no energy at all i know i'm no fun to be
around I feel
absolutely miserable I'm very painfully insecure and paranoid in my relationship
and this medication has completely changed my thinking if I had would have
known that loestrin would make me feel this bad
I would have never taken it at all so that's just three and it goes on i think
there's like a hundred and fifty reviews on this website and i immediately
started crying i was over at my parents house because i could not be alone at
all
I either had to be with mike or with Melanie my sister or my parents
those are like the only people that I wanted to see and i could not be alone
because if I was alone I would just lay in bed and hysterically cry and it's my
call my mom would ask me why you crying it would be i don't know i just have a
strong urge emotional earth i told them that i felt the way I did when my
grandmother died like when my world came tumbling down but there was no reason
because i was not upset over anything
nothing happened it was an overnight thing so after i read those reviews i
immediately stop the medication
it's been aa not that long at all i want to say 10 days since i've been off the
medication and I did take it for two months ish so there was at least there's
like at least 50 pills of that in my body so it was like a shock to read that
stuff but at the same time I did feel a lot better because at least I knew that
it was chemically induced on birth control pills are hormones and hormones
very much affect your personality and your mood and the depression and anxiety
and panicking completely skyrocketed and I didn't know how to handle it and I
still am handling it on
don't get me wrong for some reason every single morning when I wake up I still
wake up crying but it's not like all throughout the day it's just like first
thing in the morning so it's very very frustrating
um and that is what I'm going through right now
and I just felt the urge to share it with you guys because if you were going
through any of these symptoms
number one I feel for you and I completely look at depression
differently now I used to be one of those people that would say hey you can
choose to be in a good mood like shake it off
you got a house you got a bad you got food like get over yourself you know you
have nothing to be depressed about my sister used to go through this in high
school you should tell her that I'm like come on
like seriously snap out of it and now I see it's like its it has such a hold of
your brain and it's like you're not in control of your mood you're not you're
just not in control
um so that and also i just want to please urge you to look at whatever
you're putting in your body
I'm not you guys know that I'm not vegan I eat whatever i'm not talking about
food wise vitamins and I'm talking about medications especially hormones i
absolutely will never take birth control pills again in my life I've been on them
for 10 years so now that I rapidly suddenly just stop them
my body is also freaking out which i think is also adding to why I'm
constantly in the bathroom
in addition to kind of adjusting to the lexapro medicine so i'm a hot mess all
together
um yeah just be careful guys because really do your research about what you
put in your body because it can have a life-altering effect on you and I'm at
the point right now where I just have to let it get out of my system and let the
anti-depressant medication kind of combat and help me with that transition
again i'm thinking about being on it for about six months because i don't want to
be on any longer i never thought that I would be on this type of medication but
it was my absolute last resort and ya guys
so that is why i have been gone
that's why I haven't been posting on Instagram and I haven't been responding
to your comments as I normally do i'm sorry that I kind of disappeared
um and I'm sorry I also want to apologize going forward and my videos
kind of lack a little bit because it
gonna take a little while to get over this you know it's not something that
just overnight I'm gonna be okay
it's something that have to be constant act and I have to keep my life and my
brain constantly busy so i am thinking of volunteering or even actually
possibly picking up a part-time job which I really don't want to because
YouTube is my full-time job and I don't need it financially wise but i feel like
right now I'm not in a good place to be home alone all day and on not really
socializing because that's when I think think think think think
so I feel like I want to at least be on the medicine for at least like maybe two
months before I make any changes you know as far as being around other people
volunteering or getting a second job because right now not really myself and
I want to be back to myself before i'm around others which even though i know a
lot of you guys are gonna tell me to just do it now get around people force
myself which I have been trying my absolute hardest almost every single day
I've been seeing my family until my kids home and seeing my friends and forcing
myself you know going to yoga tai chi meditation on and going for walks
keeping my mind busy you know
so yes that is what I had to let you guys know and I really hope that this
video helped at least one person out there if you're going through depression
I'm so so sorry because it is honestly I honestly think this is the hardest thing
I've ever been through in my life
you don't know that I like was married to someone that was with that person for
10 years that I went through a divorce my grandma died you know that family
bullshit going on I don't want to get into but nothing compares to this
feeling nothing that I've been through my life compared to this feeling because
this like carries into everything into my work into my relationship into my
family relationship everything my life as a whole so it's very hard to just
shake because it affects everything and it sucks it really sucks but there is
hope out there
and i will be doing a video on what i do to kind of handle depression little
things that i do i'm not going to talk about it just kind of relax me when I'm
having my extreme anxiety and i know that a lot of you guys deal with anxiety
as well so i hope that some of you guys could relate to this sometimes it just
makes you feel better to know that you're not the only person out there and
I'm definitely human being just like you guys and I go through my trials and
tribulations and ups and downs and all the things that a normal person would so
alright guys i have a story time video to film now i'm going to try and finish
up my teeth so I can get some caffeine and me and helped my mood a little bit
and and thank you guys all so much for watching thank you for caring and thank
you for checking on me so much and a big thank you to my family and to Mike I
know you guys watch my videos and would not have been able to get through this
without you guys honestly would not be able to do without you so means a lot to
me and and that's the guys thank you for watching
