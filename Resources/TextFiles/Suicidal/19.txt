so I was in class today so we're just talking in class and suddenly the talk
about suicide and people jumping in front of trains to heal themselves
started popping up and this one girl in my class puts out the saying no offense
but I think people who commit suicide or selfish
I didn't I really wanted to stand up and be like yo hey who are you to say that
what if someone in this room was suicidal and you tell them that made
them feel even more like shit
which contributed to their suicidal thoughts and then I said a lot of people
who try to kill themselves they're depressed their mind mind is completely
clouded by all these feelings all these thoughts that are rational and that they
think that their burden already
they already think that the people that are in their life shouldn't shouldn't
have them because there's such a burden and that their unwanted and unloved and
that they shouldn't be here and there will be doing everybody a favor by
killing themselves
people have those thoughts because of the things in their head that makes them
feel that way because of everything that has happened to them when people try to
kill themselves they're not a rational state of mind
they don't just wake up one day rational thought and they're like you know why is
mine and they're like you know what I feel like killing myself today
no the brain is clouded by all these thoughts all these things that they
overthink and make themselves believe that people don't care because if people
who committed suicide knew that their families and their friends would truly
truly truly truly care and they wouldn't do it
it's just that they don't believe that because they think so little of
themselves and that their existence is not as important as it is so they kill
themselves and I could not stand to hear someone say something so harsh and be
like suicide is selfish and there are many things that in life that you should
say to protect others and I think that's one of those things and correct me if
I'm wrong this is just a ramble I haven't
organize anything I haven't even properly thought about this i literally
came home put my camera on this chair and wanted to talk about this because it
may be mad because to me it was an ignorant way to think to say suicide is
selfish and stop there and not continue to explain their opinions and thoughts
and why it is selfish
I always had this thought in my head after reading this quote saying that
suicide is not in the pain it passes it on to other people and that is true but
I can't think of anyone who would rationally and it's clear state of mine
just want to kill themselves
it sucks because luckily on all over
I'm all over being that clouded stage where I've constantly wanted to kill
myself
who would say someone else in the room wasn't feeling suicidal that day and
he's been hearing that and then be like man I'm so selfish i might as well just
fucking continue living even though i hate my fucking life and then just push
themselves to be more and more depressed forcing them to stay alive because they
don't want to be selfish when they should be living because there are so
many beautiful things in life and there should be living for themselves because
they have so much to contribute to this universe
we cannot live for other people we can't live because we are afraid to hit hurt
other people
we have to live for ourselves choose to live because there are so many people
left for you to inspire there's so many things left for you to learn so many
things left for you to teach so many things left for you to leave a mark on
to become permanent
you're not a disposable soul that was my little ramble
I really really really hope that all you guys who are watching this leave
something nice in the comments to those who are feeling crap
so if you're feeling crap fucking let us know and we're going to try to find a
way to cheer you up
suicide doesn't have to be that you
there at all
it should never have to be everybody please stay alive please state lease it
and please stay safe
