hey everyone i know i've been gone for a couple of days now since saturday and
it's friday right now and most of y'all don't know what happened
so this is no need to do that's gonna explain to my you and my friends they're
wondering where I've been emailing me gosh that passion that probably didn't
get trendy saturday i have you following me on snapchat you probably saw that
snapchat my last met which was like if you love me it if this is my last I love
you all and that was basically my cry out for help kind of my goodbye
everybody because I wanted to kill myself
so from I don't know what triggered it
well I do know what forget it I don't talk about that one that's gonna be
another story but basically I didn't want to live anymore so i decided to
kill myself I had a bottle of pills i was going to take at 20 such a 20
some-odd you're going hard cold and cold on whatever you want to call it for
gotta say I don't care
pills that was gonna take and i made a video actually had the video still on my
fun was back is like a suicide video like no I'm not to kill myself i love
you people this is what I'm doing it by little God and how to be on me taking
the pills and everything on my phone still right now if I wanted to watch it
i could but i have not watched it after the day so I took for a time for for for
the Atma on then I'll a store that had to take i try to take them if I left my
hit me but in like they came out right through up in the hawk only for the last
word came out my mouth and I just put it back in the bottle is said maybe I'll
take them later and then I just lay down and molding on the pills
yes I'm holding on
pills and my mom my mom and dad are gone hour later they find me
no no my mom told me she didn't know why she came in the room because it will I
did in my brothers room nobody goes in there he's gone off to college so she
comes in and she's seen me on the ground and she's like she goes to my phone
because she thinks I'm sleeping because that's what her kids do all of us we
sleep on the floor so she just thought that we were that was sleeping and stuff
but then she saw the pill bottles in the glass of water and then she got like
what is she she told me that she was mad at me because she didn't cause you
didn't understand what was going on so she was just mad why would you do this
what will make you want to do this to yourself mom found me and she goes
straight to my phone to see why did that because she was just mad at me because
she doesn't know she didn't understand at the time so I go so she goes against
my dad my dad comes rushing to me chop he yelled at my mom call 911 caller
called 911 because he realized that our Modi I can't but i kinda want to get up
but I clicking like I was so
oh I was already and I couldn't get up i was just laying there so my dad khan and
so they pick me up he picks me up take me outside makes me walk around in
circles and i'm crying I'm telling why did and all that and then the police
comes and the 15 minutes later after the police come the analyst come so take
them like a good 30 minutes before they come & get get me put me into the
influence and they take me to the hospital I was about to tell you what
the hospital but forgot can't do that it's Amy's in the hospital and they
write they want to start me and stuff like that it's like my blood
I'm they don't have to watch me because the type of job I took toady if I'm not
monitored let Michael slow down my breathing and I could die or like like
stuff like that the monitor
the doctor comes in to me comes in the room and tells me if you got took one
more pill you would have died she said she didn't say like that she said if you
have to one more you would have got poison basically she didn't tell me she
was going out but basically that's what she told me and I'm like wow who had
meeting who did that because I didn't do that was so I'm just thinking like
somebody angel myself like hit me something for it to light
stop yeah so at the four hours in the emergency room
I'm taken by ambulance to another hospital a mental hospital and i have to
say there for days without contacting people the only only got 10 out 10
minutes a day to talk to my mom
you can see that was really in there like I'm not joking like that banned
from the hospital but yeah I can only call my mom for 10 minutes every day in
the first couple of days it was like well the first day I couldn't walk
because i was still dizzy and stuff from codeine so I didn't want for the first
half of today then I got my walking field again right now I have trouble
remembering stuff and I get startled easily like if so my phone goes off like
someone calls and I'll jump or somebody on grades my doorbell i'll jump in the
car eyes I jump loud noises make me jump i'm kinda jumpy
so if you see me at school please do not
yup come yelling at me asha asha asha because you're going to scare me and
probably cry so don't do it the same
don't do it and the reason why didn't jesus i should tell y'all that y'all
probably just watch that whole spiel like the girl's crazy
I have depression i have a severe depression i need to stop saying that
and my accident maybe I have anxiety so I'm have antidepressant now I've had
depression all my life that I'm not gotten it treated with and that's what
led it to kill time to come on try to control it
that led to trying to commit suicide so yeah and I'm saying this I'm not crying
is which is very surprising because that means my internet the president is
working a little suited desolate that's right there the depressant I should not
be saying that my antidepressant is working to it was special do this my
depression is making me feel like I should be working see is the disorder is
a mental disorder that's what i was at a mental hospital because something in my
brain tells me that I should be happy and you should always be happy you feel
the same as I do in that loving yourself have low self-esteem and stuff like that
interviews emotionally or physically you should tell somebody that was my problem
I didn't tell anybody I felt so bad and I didn't tell anybody look I have so
many great friends that came to when told by chose not to shows the arm by my
balance by my own but everybody's help and I forgot that everybody's out and
being at the hospital it was like everyday i'm not trying to grind every
day so my else will come in the hospital trip for trying to commit suicide and it
was like so many people when i first got in there it was a people and when I like
it was 15 new people
it was just like wow all of us could show
Ben it shouldn't have been here today but we're here so I enjoy my life so
much right now just thinking about it and I just feel blessed down here today
and adding my guardian angel saved my life i don't believe in like well said I
don't believe there's a god but I don't believe in like defining and play them
in a category i just believe there's a lot so to like remind me that I'm not
alone and stuff and that is not just me and that my I have situation but any
other this gonna be everybody's going to their own battles and that you should
not judge people by how they look in that you everybody has own battles
basically and if your balance of you shouldn't be balanced by yourself
axwell so I'm going to try to put the date of where i should I which is 11 jun
2015 that's why I like say that now like 11-7 I should i forgot to mention God
getting another chance and it's hard because i'm probably going to have bad
resource in my life because I had my GPA is probably going down to join because i
had been to school in a week I shouldn't be worried about that right now should
be worried about anybody but you know studious person God think about it a
little too therapist today actually and talk about going back to school but i'm
not sure if I'm allowed to go back to school for money but I'm gonna try that
and like it they told me i'm not going to like you know and like thank you guys
for all your love and your support and I'm sorry to all of my friends I'm so
sorry to put you through this
I know like yeah I didn't like I didn't know what was going on yard a lot of
people came
every day oh yeah I coming back a lot of people running that everyday everything
is always the new person every day and that one that really got to me was like
day there's a there's so much I feel this up every day in it just like wow
try not to cry but I just have to take how to like Adam I like so many
different coping skills like doing this and this we do this he squeeze your
palms and you like open it you can like feel the tension release it off your
hands and like breathing peanut butter tacos
pause breathe they don't want to so many coping skills and I learned not to hide
my emotions not to like smile when I'm sad to tell somebody
so yeah I feel like I've overcome my depression but sometimes i don't think
that I have it under control because some days I just be crying and it's
gonna get better have to think keep telling myself it's gonna get better
it's gonna get better it's gonna get better because once it gets better it
will be better and it teaches in there they really helped me like want one
teacher choose our mean that not beautiful and talented I'm worthy and I
deserve better and I should tell myself that every day or twice two times a day
and I do that and I'm kind of thinking that now so like these videos using your
videos I know myself I look happy I seen that beat but i want to say is offer
showcase so I really am happy but a my depression made me feel like my sadness
was me like I'm i was always sad but I would just be like I guess I'm supposed
to be sad every day
I didn't think that enough it but no you're not
that was depression and I just didn't know what it was so awesome stories
about being in there but that'd be another video so thanks for watching i
love you all so so much
thanks for supporting me k and i love you all
that's why y'all haven't seen your videos and stuff because I'm dealing
with something right now so chooses to next time
