I'm not gonna waste any of you guys time first of all I want to say thank you for
everyone who supports me and shows me mad crazy love it really means the world
to me
more than you'll ever know I appreciate it I just want to tell you guys
first I have a crazy bad anxiety panic attacks
bipolar disorder anger problems
just a pile of this huge list of things that arm around me pretty much when I
have these attacks or whatever just don't know if anyone understands because
it feels like no one does everyone just tells me to chill out just to relax
- - calm down and honestly I can't like it's like something goes off in my head
i feel that i would really feel like I feel like but flames just ignited in my
brain and like my mind is racing with all these starts my arm my body just
tingles
it's the fucking worst feeling ever like i can't control ii and i lash out and do
things that I don't want to do and say things that that I shouldn't say because
because of it and it's not the person I want to be because the core root of who
r m is a happy loving person and wants to you know give that and spread that
into the world and it and it be positive and happy and it is sucks it really
sucks because it's not only hurting me but it's hurting other people around me
is pushing people away
and it's losing people that I love and I'm close to
and there's no there's no worse feeling than that but it's not the person I want
to do is I know it's not it's not the right thing to do is it's not like I
intentionally doing any of this or or or what but it's hard because it feels like
no one gets it like no one everyone thinks it's like I just just just really
like chill out
like I'm telling myself that too like I'm I know I shouldn't be doing this but
it's like I can't control it and so I need to like figure out what I need to
take my pill
whatever I need to do it to fix this because it's controlling my life and
it's scary because i want to i want to start a family and I want to be happy
and healthy and and
you know be there for the people that care about me and just live a full and
happy life
that's that's all i want is all anybody really wants to the end of the day and I
want to spread that to you guys and and without YouTube and you know the old
just be happy model like just be happy with more for me than anything because
if I didn't have that I probably would not be here today
arm have suicidal thoughts frequently and it's not normal
it's not because it's like when i get my dark places
it's like deep it's really really deep and it feels like there's no coming out
of it and I feel like sometimes the only reason I'm still here is because you
know i don't have the tools to take my own life I me I I mean I could like are
really really really wanted to but I just I just isolate myself because i
know that you know I've been that dark and down but there is light in there is
hope and to find that that glimmer of hope to keep North so
I don't know me i just want to say I'm sorry to everyone for for you know being
someone that I don't want to be and it sucks because my biggest fears is ending
up alone man just because because the shit that that's not me
you know it's not who I want to be
we gotta fix it
I'm going to fix it you know so
will be action
yeah
right now I just I can't say I'm okay but I acknowledge it and I'm willing or
ready to fix that so
that's what I'm gonna do again I'm sorry for anyone that I push away or hurt and
but blame towards because it's not your fault
I take the blame 1000% again thank you guys for watching and supporting me and
you're a big reason why I keep going I'm going to continue to keep going and try
to stay as strong as possible because I know I'm starting in this
