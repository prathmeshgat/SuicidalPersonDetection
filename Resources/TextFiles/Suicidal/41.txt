hi everyone my name is Kristen most of you know me but just in case someone
stumbles upon us that doesn't know me i want to give you a little bit of a
background kind of story before i jump right in
so I'm 24 I live in a small town in Ontario and I just graduated from my
Masters of Social Work degree and just move back in with my parents because I
got a job in my hometown and will close to my hometown in the field i wanna be
working in social work in geriatrics because I start specialized in
gerontology in school and my in both my degrees which is gerontology is the
study of older adults so yeah that's just a little bit about me so you kind
of can understand who I am now i guess i need to get into the story so not too
long ago I was at a music festival with a bunch of my friends and my boyfriend
and we had gone to the concert
yeah we had just gone in we were on enjoying some of the music just chilling
and having a really good time the weather was hot I was so hot now to give
you a little understanding I haven't seen my boyfriend in a little bit
because me moving home meant that we were going to be three hours driving
distance apart for me I was like I was spent every moment with him like now
that we're together this weekend
like with all my friends of course and i want to steal them a hundred percent but
i also want to make sure we have time for us whether it's just like seeing a
band just the two of us or I don't know something like that you want us to
seclude ourselves from the group or making them feel comfortable and things
like that which of course I wouldn't want you there but I think we just kind
of had a slightly different ideas about how to make that work so we have been a
couple bands on that Saturday and then he was going to go back for a nap on
and another friend was going to go back i think a few people were going to go
because they wanted to come rest up before the evening when a lot of thing
cool bands we're gonna be on so that was cool that's fine except what i had been
drinking and I was like really you're gonna go back like I just want to have a
nap
I'm like but like really you're gonna go back like you're just gonna leave you're
just going to leave really jolly but like i don't i just wanna have fun now
but i just want to be ready for that tonight like what's the big deal
a part of me was like I was I was looking over this fight about to start
and watching and some of the things are saying we're just not how I was feeling
I made accusations that he was going back because our my the one other girl
was going back and he wanted to spend time with hard and I like literally as I
was saying that I was like why don't you say like there's part of me that was
like that is so not true
so essentially he was going back to lay down i followed him and was yelling at
him and being like are you seriously doing this right now like know you get
to see each other
I like I honestly can't tell you everything that I think it's just like
spewing like all this talk I him across the chest which I don't do that and I
threw his phone anyone miss so then I went to my car
and I just felt like super top like I just was like I just need to get out get
out and out
I can't be here I can't be here like I can't do this I can't do this i'm i'm
psycho I'm so saying I'm so like what's wrong with me i'm psycho i need to get
out and try out i need to stop hurting people I need to stop doing this you
need to stop creating drama and fight and ruining everything for everyone and
ruin everything of ruin everything
psycho why am I here why am I here what am i doing
just like him truck and trap them traffic you get out and dropped why they
do this but i do is again
YY like all these like racing Racing racing Racing racing to get I have to
get out how to get out so I was hyperventilating sweating sweating like
so much is my face is flushed that was close by pink colors i took all the
pills in my bottle i was just frantic about it i took them like as fast as I
could I was chugging the back and just like staring out people were walking by
like this is in the middle of this huge like camp site kind of thing people were
everywhere people just walking by going to the concert going back to their can't
say my friends were just up ahead just kind of looking one they're looking for
my boyfriend's can't phone and then I saw they found it because i was also
frantic about that too like you lost his phone how can you do that like yeah
anyways they found this phone and they were just kind of chilling I think they
were giving me space to cool down to and then i took i had had like a cold kind
of that we can like the week before and stuff so I had brought some
like cold pills like day and night once I took all of those there's probably
like 745 or something of each day and night one so i took all of those also
but it's not that I wanted to kill myself I just wanted to not be there
I just wanted to disappear i wanted to not exist I just wanted to get out and I
was frantic and I was not in my right bit of mind at all obviously so that's
what happened and find my friend
my best friend came up to the car to you know shit from me spacing to cool down
but you wanted to you know check out me and I told the right way which cart
remember forever face and she's read the next thing I know my friends cat the car
in the first response team cool i actually knew the guy he was boyfriend's
friend and he was hanging out with this earlier
Vicki back end unless they came and got me and I went to the like first aid kind
of tent and I just I was I don't even know is it's all such a blur from there
eventually went to the hospital and I was so out of it like I don't even
always happening but my friends call me parents
yeah parents came up I
so I I just felt like I didn't really talk much about the last part they're so
like I said um I went to the first-aid time at the festival on they kind of did
some asking some questions that sort of thing kind of figured out what try to
figure out what's going on and it and then I went to the hospital and I was
therefore believe 24 hours I wasn't more than more than 24 actually believe they
didn't admit me but I was in the ER the whole time and I just was given
medication through IV that attacks all of the pink colors that were my body and
there's no liver damage also my friends tried to visit me at the hospital but
they wouldn't let them come see me i don't know what was really happening my
friends my boyfriend i should have been saying partner this whole time I'm
really bad cut at getting into the habit of thing partner to be gender-neutral as
opposed to seeing your friend but I'm sorry for that and so that yeah they try
to visit and weren't able to come up the people at the hospital were so amazing
like so amazing huh
um you know I had really good conversations with them
the paramedic in the ambulance with me she was amazing telling me how she had
been through the exact same thing and look where she is now and you know you
have a future and and you know you can overcome that the mental-health nurse
that was at the hospital because they didn't admit me on a form 1 i'm into the
hospital because my parents were there we had a plan now see a psychologist we
had figured that kind of out that we would be doing that i was going to be
going to my doctor asked
ap and not whole thing so they didn't for me especially because it was away
from home they didn't want me to be secluded and isolated and that wouldn't
have been good you know recovery but yeah from like the mental-health nurse
just the other nurses i was asking for water almost constantly I felt like
because my mouth is so dry and they were so accommodating and just like the kind
looks and everything I was just like huh
everyone was amazing and my friends like we're amazing too
I mean all of them just telling me how much she loved me you know and you know
reminding me that you know they're there if i ever need to talk to them and I
know that if I was ever feeling that way I could talk to so many people now I'm
it's not that I didn't think that before it was just that I was in such a panic
then and so for me like what people might think like well how are you going
to prevent that from happening again right and for a bit a big thing for me
is that I'm not really drinking anymore so some people have noticed my friends
I'm very partner notice that you know sometimes you just get kind of like
really emotional when i'm drunk and I would cost fight with him and things
like that so for me I will drink like casually so i'll have like my favorite
drink is like a Caesar so I have like a see there you know things like that i
really enjoy but I i mean in no way is having fun for one night getting drunk
when like is that ever worth my life like know that ever worth my
relationships my you know every like no it's never never ever going to be worth
it i'm not saying that people like I don't see my friends or anyone i know
should you know stop drinking or stop drinking cavalier whatever I just know
that that's what I need
do at least for now and of course like i said i'm seeing a psychologist I do a
lot of journaling i have done it for about like four this whole year I got
into journaling a lot more and it has been something that I've been off and on
throughout my life but I'm doing that a lot more i'm doing more yoga
I'm doing more mindfulness so I do more meditation like for me I just had to
find that worked for me right and maybe it feels weird like to talk to say like
I said like so many times geez
huh but sometimes it can feel embarrassing to say oh well i'm going to
i'm not going to drink and I have to you know I have to go to yoga i have to make
time for that in my week and sometimes it can be kind of like how do I feel
like I feel like I'm not flexible you know I mean I feel like you know i have
to stick to my routine i have to do these things I have to make sure you
know I write in my journal in the morning I have to to take time to
reflect on everything that I'm grateful for I have to do those things and so
sometimes it makes me feel like I can't really just go with the flow like maybe
some of my friends can but we're all different we often find what works for
us anyways I always have so much to talk about in all this regard
so if anyone wants to talk about anything or yeah the feel free and i can
fly their own forever but i think that was kind of the point i just wanted to
tell my story
