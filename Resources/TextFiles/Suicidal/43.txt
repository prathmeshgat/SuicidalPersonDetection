it's really hard to make ok so this is I guess really second time talking about
this to people like actually talking about it and not just posting it on
social media and I can Instagram post on tumblr house or anything
I'm so bear with me I was actually going to write down like notes i would make
sure that I wouldn't forget anything so i could say everything and make sure
that you get my point across i don't get lost but i decided not to my heart's
like pounding great now I'm i really wanted to speak from the heart and this
video and hope that you know that comes off across more i'm obviously heartfelt
and genuine and I guess we'll just see where that ends up taking me for this so
I'm just gonna start at the beginning I guess that way i can just kind of tell
the story of how i got to where it was and how I got to where I am now so I'm
yes if you can't tell from the title of whatever this video is going to be this
is going to be about my struggles with depression and self harm so and i'm
already giving water okay get your shit together Marissa ok so i would say that
it all started
probably i'm a hot younger than I remember it being i would say probably
four to fifth grade is when it really started and when I started to notice it
and I'm kind of know that something wasn't right so I know what this is
you know I really get it's just no one should ever say that they were depressed
in there in fifth grade
and when i was ten years old that is a shipping say and you know I wouldn't
even push it against my biggest enemy or against anyone in the world at all i'm
ok so growing up
ok
growing up I didn't have the best family life i'm not going to go into too much
detail about it because obviously there's other people involved than just
me I'm and I do love my family dearly but just the kind of skim over it
I'm anyone who's friends with me kind of knows exactly what was going on and from
about third grade to like 7th 8th grade
I'm it just it it was rough
um i received a lot of pressure from my parents had a very own nature again
starting around second grade 2 and kind of be like the perfect child I and you
know I when they I literally hear what held on to my mom she was crying and she
was just praying and she was just saying don't end up like this don't be like
that and I'll never forget that day I want to forget that day for a very long
time I feel like I had to kind of keep and her together
I guess so say I'm not so much as I took care of her but just kind of give her
hope I guess in a sense that and you know i'd be like every parent's dream I
guess so like I said it just it wasn't a good situation
growing up it I
no I'm not close with my parents are was close with my parents at all and I don't
really have like a solid relationship i would say as far as good of a
relationship if I wish that I did on top of what was happening at school was a
lot for me to handle on I was bullied a lot in elementary school like a lot and
I would literally go into class every single day and fifth-grade bawling my
eyes out to his teacher because of what was happening and at recess time and it
wasn't just that resize just in general and you know I didn't have any friends I
did I still have no clue why or what happened or what I did to how what
happened to me happen there was literally a group of girls who created a
club called the I hate Mercer price Club which first off very fucking creative
name ok imagination of fifth-graders I don't know but I'm it sucked sucked
really bad and fifth grade was awful I when I didn't know how to handle it i
don't know what to do and i started self-harming i started actually
self-harming when I was in fourth grade but I'm i started cutting myself when I
was in fifth grade
I'm when i first started self-harming and fourth-grade don't see this I feel
like a lot of people don't know that are some people around
it's just kind of like the mainstream I don't want to say that because it's not
mainstream i'm cutting its not mainstream it's not a bad and it's not
something people just do to get attention and a lot of people think that
that's the only way to self-harm and that's not true you can i'm not going to
say a bunch of ways for people to do it because i don't want to give people
yes or anything like that but when i started in 4th grade i would have memory
so sheets
I'm i take my fingernails and I was always this arm and I take them into my
skin and tell my arm went numb started bleeding are I just until like the pain
would go away and I do it in public because I are just anywhere where I was
just feeling an overwhelming sense of pain or sadness or anything that I was
feeling on I would do it because it was the one thing that took my mind off of
whatever it was that was happening at the moment I'm and you don't no one
could tell that I was doing it i'm from 5th grade I remember the first time I
come himself i was in shower and I was bawling my eyes out i was asking God why
like why me know when I was ten years old and I looked over and saw a bobby
pin just sitting
come on like the shelf of the shower and broke it in half and that was the first
time that I cut myself I'm so starting then just going to fast-forward a bit
because this video is already a very long and I'm so from fourth grade and so
going into middle school
I'm you know I would say hate saying this but I'm you know its transparency
right because of everything that had happened and elementary school I was and
I kind of became like the mean kit because I you know I couldn't go through
i don't want to go through again I'm what I went through and elementary
school however that did not exactly work for me and I'm not going to go into too
much detail about it but the middle school has not any better than it was in
elementary school
if anything it was worse and you know kids
get obviously easier with age and on you know i will never ever ever ever forget
anything that I ever happened to me and as much as I wish I could never
I'm be able to forget or forgive the people who know what caused me so much
pain on in middle school I became very very very good at hiding what I was
feeling you know you could probably ask anyone that was funds at the time and
they would have had no clue of all I'm what I was going through it up over time
especially going into about eighth grade I and i'm just going to say like this
because the only way i can think of right now I was basically like a
professional at putting a mask on and smiling in front of people and being
like the happy person there was actually a person you called me a e-mail
butterfly because I wore all black box always been my favorite color but I i
was happy bubbly I'm like in person like talking to people and everything
um so yes middle school and by I'm just going to try and get through this a
little bit so I can get to high school but and I was still struggling
obviously with depression and self harm I'm it wasn't a daily thing like it
ended up becoming it was sometimes weekly and sometimes I would go a couple
months without doing that I'm but I fast forward to high school
I'm i started getting really really tired of hiding my emotions
I'm you know in freshman year was obviously high school in general just a
fucking shit show
I'm really and the freshman year was ok I'm it was just kind of there and do
some shit happened that was obviously hard for me to deal with i'm not going
to say that because again there's other people involved however something
happened
I'm going into my sophomore year and kind of changed everything for me I'm is
kind of the beginning of a very very very steep downward spiral
I'm maybe just I I can't go into that because i don't want to people that are
watching this probably know who I'm talking about what I'm talking about if
you're thinking about the timeframe
I'm but yeah so going into software and i'm struggling really really hard to
figure out who I was and who I wanted to be and I was just exhausted you guys I
was completely exhausted i remember one night I was I don't write like at all at
all but i would want to run when they the clock at you and they're just
running I have no idea where I was going and at one point I just fell to the
ground not because I tracked but i just fell to the ground and I remember
looking at
can print the God that I just told me you know I good i know i can hold under
such a great liar
okay because I'm anyway I couldn't hold on much longer I didn't have much left
to mute and if things continue the way that they were going to want to have be
here much longer
so now going to that was some are going into my sophomore year sophomore year
was items down be worst year of my life will be hard for me to think back on it
because everything that are spilling was just so we're you all think you can
still feel it i think about it for a year
I you know I had great friends I have still have great friends with so friends
that out the people that helped me get through that your knee and of my friends
we got really into church with 12 seriously you guys see what my view it
and I stopped drinking and you don't I spent every Wednesday going to youth
group and not youth group heat changes in so many ways
um ok
go anymore but just I can't even express to you guys the amount of love how much
hope and faith that please those people gave me it was home that was the one
place that I felt like I can be myself out which it was a great feeling because
I couldn't do that for a very long time so sophomore year and what I'm my
ex-boyfriend and those are definitely the three main people really were my
solid foundation I'm I you know as I was saying before i was getting really
exhausted with a hiding what I was feeling um and I I couldn't do it
anymore i couldn't do it anywhere I I I can't even explain what it was that I
was feeling a bit
I feel like any anyone who's been depressed knows what i'm going to be
talking about but it at the numbness but it was worse than um it was just nothing
like nothing was there I started putting myself every day or every other day but
it was definitely a lot more than it used to be and it was this bad
it took a long time for me to open up about that for me to open up about
anything it was the church and the people that I surround myself with that
allowed me to open up and talk about what it was which was
it was believed really big and really really relieving and really the only way
that I can explain how I felt
sophomore year delicious that I was absolutely hopeless i have to hope for
anything here there was there was a medic church isn't a 17-16 is the day
after this state right here on and we actually had a guest pastor who was
speaking and I just felt in overwhelming sense to go talk to him and talk to him
and told him what had been going on and he asked me he said when was the last
time that you cut yourself and then yesterday
he said I only want you to do this if you're going to be true to yourself and
only if you're going to do it is ok he said I want that be the last time that
you cut yourself I want you to promise yourself that that's going to be the
last time that you do that I'm just gonna stop there it off your second
right because I really stop don't have it ready to start the Cardinals the know
but I do know that i had to figure out if I do that I let's do it for myself to
say yes but so I said yes and I prayed for being says or just active not sell
for me was extremely hard for me to do
self-harming to me cutting myself was it almost became like an addiction
I became addicted to be feeling that i have what i would do it and you know I
didn't feel pain when I did it I felt better I felt relieved and you know that
I had some sense of control over what was actually happening in my life that
I'm if i was going to feel pain I could do it myself it would be because i
wanted to because I wanted to feel something other than all the shit that
was going on around me so not having that sense of believe not having that
sense of I'm in control for once this is one thing that I can actually control it
was extremely extremely hard
there's so many days where I just all I wanted to do with cut myself but I pray
and I pray to God to help get me through this and he did he good about dogs
really nice lb and about to my about two months after this I'm you know I had
stopped cutting myself but i was still struggling really really hard with
depression and i ended up breaking up with the guy that I was dating at the
time
um but yeah i'm not going to go into that I'm however a lot of stuff happened
after that on part of it to being stuff that was steady over social media
it was a lot for me to take in
I felt extremely alone
it's just it all came crashing down everything just came to a halt on
so today is august $YEAR 13 three years ago I was scrolling through Twitter and
that was seeing some things that people were some tweeting about me which was
the it was iceberg and I was the fucking Katie meg and that was the last straw
seeing what people are saying and then you know just on top of everything that
happened over the last six years it was just I was done
you know I didn't want to live anymore i was gotten those I thought I have no
purpose
uh-huh
you know I'd never be that child that my parents wanted me to be that I have no
friends no one cared about me I thought I was very very very alone so I went
into my parents room and look through all the pillows that they had in their
room there was a bottle of painkillers that were there we counted how many were
in there and there was 32 of them and i took every single one of them remember I
was sitting in the college and I was watching TV maybe taking out two or
three palaces of the time just waiting for it and for me to just stop breathing
all of a sudden it was his own twist again like relieving to just know that
you know there's going to be an end to this that all the pain and suffering
wasn't going to happen and you want that it was finally over and down finish
taking pills i'm sitting on the calc in open session days who was almost like I
was like drunk or something had happened to save it but I'm sitting there and I
started to not feel too good and I
I spent five hours throwing up that late every single pellet I took and obviously
I should've died I took 32 painkillers and I have I remember this day so so so
clearly i was growing up I couldn't breathe I that I was actually prayed to
God to just have it stop it wasn't yet haven't stopped as I have I end it was
just everything I remember praying and asking you to forgive this it's forgive
people but I have you and it's not like she always runs over to be okay baby
remember basically word for word what grade for it was over and over and over
again in between each time that I do up it was kind of God saved me that if you
kept me alive I would do whatever it took to make him proud to share my story
and save someone else's life up and move over and over and over again and
eventually I stopped i'm going up and going to bed that night not knowing the
farmers gotta wake up in the morning I they did and I have never been so have
you to be like
that I was that obviously i wouldn't go back and change change it for anything i
want to change attempted suicide at all and we me who I am today in anything
I've never had such a lot from that I have after that day I after that couple
days after i went to church camp and that was I actually before i overdosed i
texted my pastors and I said that I wasn't going to go anymore and it's why
I just said I don't want you I obviously it was because of what i said . feeling
and I woke up the next morning and they take said that and I asked them if it
wasn't too late for me to go
lord knows that maybe the trips q that more than anything and they did a church
camp it was the most amazing experience of my life
it was it was amazing and had never felt so much love from strangers for anyone
that had those like four days that i was there in the first time that I ever
talked about this too and a group of people and it was that I shared my
testimony church the following wednesday so sure wasn't 35 minutes like this is
if you're still watching this
bless your heart like a fucking documentary
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for God and I know that for a fact I you know
that exterior was extremely confusing you know I knew I should have been dead
but i'm so confused as to you know like I why would come to save me like I have
you know i still felt like I don't really have anything to offer besides my
story had no idea what it was what it was that he or how it was that he wanted
me to share what I had been through out and put the howling like i was very
confused i had no idea what my purpose was on in the world and you know again
that was a very lonely feeling
um just junior was so rough and obviously I'm struggling with everything
that I had been trying to overcome it on and i felt very lonely jittery are very
difficult and I still struggling with depression but it was not as bad as it
was the previous years
I'm you know again I had great friends that I return to which is so important
if you're going through something even if they don't necessarily know what's
going on even though i highly encourage you telling at least one person about it
talk to them
I didn't tell anybody really until all software year maybe someone that you
trust someone that you know is going to be there for you and help you and guide
you through it it's so important to have someone in your corner just so you know
you don't feel long and this kind of goes back to me questioning like why did
god save me I'm how we're going to share this story and
and you know obviously my journey with working out and fitness and competing
has allowed me to do that I truly believe that I was made it to be an
outlet for people to be able to share my story and i'm open up to people and
hopefully have people open up to me in order for me to change someone's life
and you know this channel and buy instagram and tumblr has done that it
has given me the opportunity to opportunity to speak thousands and
thousands and thousands of people much more than like that two or three hundred
people that were in church that day that I first shared my testimony and and you
know i think that that all along was God's plan for me was for me to go
through all of the absolute how that I had gone through the previous years to
be where I'm sitting right now talking to you guys as transparent as forgets to
tell my story to tell you that there is hope I'm you know I no longer struggle
with all those and evens that I had was sugaring with for so long and that being
said and I do have a hard time differentiating the like bad days bad
weeks with being depressed again and it's kind of a terrifying so it's still
something that I'm trying to not necessarily overcome but I'm I guess
I still have to i don't i don't know how to explain it but I was just kind of
explained in this way but I'm exhaust couple weeks three weeks I have been
really hard for some reason I don't know why I kind of have faces of going into a
good like dumbness again and it terrifies me
it could be for nothing nothing happened but i'll just get numb for like a week
or two and that scares the shit out of me every single time
um and it makes me question everything i'm going to press it again
what is going on like why am I feeling this way again and you know that's why i
haven't made a video in the last week or two it's because I could try to work on
myself in you know I have to think I feel like it's important for people and
i still need to realize this that you know if you're coming off of like a
depression background it's ok to do not be ok it's ok to have a bad date have a
bad week huh support
it's okay to feel known sometimes you know like if you like for so many people
that have been through similar stuff that I have you know it scares the shit
outta you and sometimes start feeling this things that you were feeling not
too long ago that put you in a place where you attempted to take your life
like it scary thing and you know I just kind of had to sit back and you know
remind myself of everything that I've overcome and everything that I've done
and wouldn't as soon as I start to think about that it fills my heart so just joy
because I i do I feels I feel free 411 I feel like you know it's crazy because I
never thought that there would be a gay where I truly be happy I didn't I am
I never thought that there'd be a day where I felt at peace i felt joy I felt
happiness for just no apparent reason on you and just thought be why i don't know
it makes me really becoming emotional um especially two day today is three years
exactly that I i tried to take my life which is why i started to make this
video today because today is always been a emotional day for me and it is kind of
you turning point in my life I feel like a lot of people would look at attempting
suicide as like the love seat i'm in your life but I kind of think of it I
the high point i guess in a sense just marry such a set of rock bottom but it
was both it was absolute rock bottom but that day at it changed be you know you
never realize how precious life is at all it's almost taken away from you and
you really don't i even though i've been able to you know share my story and
share how you know I've been able to overcome depression and self harm the
grace of god and the help of God and faith of God and you know what the
strength you actually have within yourself
I'm i thought i was very very weak for a long time but when you look back on it
and knowing that you know i made it through how all that absolute help for
such a long time I think I extremely shocked not only for just making it as
far as they did
but for making it to where i am now I said this and Instagram post the other
day but it is so true it's so unbelievably true and i just wish that
more people do it whether you're religious or not you know you can put
into your own terms but God gives his strongest battles the hardest battles
the lowest valleys to those he knows will overcome it he would not put you
through anything that you would not be able to overcome he would not put you
through hell if you didn't think that there would be a purpose for it if there
would be some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and you know this this is
my life being able to talk openly to potentially thousands of people that you
can watch this video about you know what I had been through that to me that is
hope and help that up for you to know that I'm here I am after going through
struggling with what i had for so long to being to where I am now and actually
feeling happy here at happiness it in so many people don't think that they that
they will be able to overcome but it is that they're going through and you know
I that's why I'm here and I'm here to tell you that it does get better and I
know that's so fucking cliche to say but it is so so true
uh you know you just you can't give up on yourself and you can't give up on
your life and you know you have to have even just in ads of faith you know so
far so far faith will take you and I don't mean faith in like a religious
sense but faith in yourself and faith in your future will take you so many places
even just one tiny glimmer of hope just one day and you know that's kind of what
you hold onto is the hope that you know one day you are going to feel like p
someone that you are going to be happy and
you will have to fight for it
nothing you know honestly even life itself is not worth living if you don't
have to fight for it
I'm fight for your happiness and fight for your right not necessarily your
right to be happy but right to be who you want to be like to be the person
that you want to be you know I part of the reason why I would change anything
that I have been doing for anything is not only because it made me who I am but
I really just wanted to let you guys know that you know it does get better
talk to someone if you can talk to someone I'm if you're religious or if
that's something that you're into whether it's not something you into go
to church or don't go to church do whatever it is that I do something that
brings you happiness and that gives you that glimmer of hope it's so important
to just have something to hold onto
even if it's the smallest day to hopefully hopefully hopefully just give
one person out there hope that it gets better
I you know I promise you you keep fighting you don't give up
there's going to be a day where you just feel such an overwhelming make sense of
joy and peace and happiness and you're gonna look back on everything that you
have that they're going to say wow you're going to be incredibly happy that
you didn't give up and that he did everything you could to overcome it
it makes life so much more than what you think it is it truly does it life is so
much more than just living breathing it's about experiencing you know every
person deserves to be happy person truly does deserve to be happy on that's just
my opinion and you know like i said earlier in the very beginning I would
not wish depression or self-harm
against anybody I wish no one ever in a million years have to experience just a
tiny tiny glimpse of what it was that I was feeling for six years because it is
the hardest thing I've ever had to do was overcoming depression stopping self
harming our stop self-harming again it was you know with the inner strength
that you actually have to underestimate how strong you are really even if you
just look back on you know what what it was that you were struggling with our
are struggling with obviously you have some strength in you because you
wouldn't be here if you didn't and you know pray you pray a lot
so much so so much and you know again it was God gave me hope and you saved my
life and I'll forever be grateful for that and all forever do whatever it is I
have to do to share my story to tell my story and I really hope that this can
just you know if I can relate to one person who's watching this video and
someone out there just like that's me I'm there I'm you know reach out to me
if you can talk to meet if you don't have anyone to talk to i'm always here
for people to talk to your friend about what they're struggling with on because
I know how lonely it can feel and I will do whatever whatever I can have to help
anyone i try to overcome it because I don't want anyone to get to where I was
you know I feel like that's the beautiful thing about social media is it
it has given me the outlet to so many more people and to have the opportunity
to potentially
out to so many more people and I'm truly grateful for that
so if you're struggling with depression or self-harm you know there's also
hotlines out there for you to call find a friend or family member I'm teacher
posture anyone that you feel like you can talk to and open up to them you can
open up to me you can DM me on Instagram message me on tumblr and I put those
things in the comments below
just know that there are so many people out there that really do love and care
for you so many more than you actually think that there that there is um and
you know I feel like it's important to say this but so many people would truly
miss you if you decided to take your own life
I'm so keep on holding on
don't don't ever give up on yourself whatever you do keep on fighting keep on
fighting even if it's the hardest thing you've ever done in your life don't give
up
look forward to that day where you're going to feel happiness because it is
coming whether it's a day from now week from now a year from now 10 years from
