hey guys so I'm sorta NASA and today I'm going to be doing a video about
depression as is something I so for with every day for the past 11 years and I
was extremely hesitant and nervous about doing this video because it's a lot of
pain for me and it's a lot of things that I actually think back on and and I
had a very very unpleasant evening on saturday night which my good friend
you see so cliff help me out with who you may know as one-half of losing Kalin
she's a very good friend of mine
she spent two hours on the phone with me
father was crying and sobbing and nature there on the edge and she told me that
this would be a good idea that i may be able to help from people so i am very
very sad and very nervous cause I'm about to talk about things that I don't
talk to anybody about you in a bit
tell me already it's a disease that nobody really understands unless they
either habit
are they know somebody with it depression is different for everybody
I can only tell you my experiences and what caused mine
I what I think cause mine and how I deal with it and I've walked down some things
on my fall
just because i tend to lose track
I been suffering with depression and anxiety for about 11 years
the first feelings that I remember of it was about 14 and I'm 25 now
at that time I didn't know that that's what it was I just seems to feel sad and
angry Oh up and I thought that it was to his part being 14 you both to me it
seemed a little extreme
I used to dread going to school in the morning and I plate true and a lot and
which caused a lot of problems but I used to do silly things in the morning
because i didn't want to go to see you
like I used to go downstairs and open the front door
then just sit and then sleep box there so that my mom would they got to school
or I used to hide in my water all before she went to work so she thought that I
would have already gotten up and gone to skew I used to hide in my bed
everything I could do just to avoid school because when i was there i didn't
like it
I felt thick just it was a place that made me feel sad that I didn't
understand why I hate it so much by did and eventually they gave up on me and I
practically got kicked out of school I don't have any gcse's and i started on a
program in college which is kind of worthy send a lot of the naughty kids so
I thought that that's what was wrong with me always just not you know I was
kind of like it's airway teen it was about 40 ish the I kind of knew
that I was gay not well not that I knew that I was gay
I knew that something was different and that something wasn't how we supposed to
be and by the time I kind of was sixteen seventeen i need that it was a
possibility that could be gay so that pop a lot of pressure on me because I
come from a family where we don't talk about our feelings were not decipher
family the hook each other we don't tell each other that we love each other and
my dad is a bullet
I need prejudice any racist and I thought there was never ever going to be
a way that i could admit to my family that I'm gay
I have a forward the siblings I have three sisters and a brother my sister my
brother from my mom's previous marriage who I've always grown up with and then I
have two sisters when my dad's previous marriage who I didn't know until i was
nine but with them both that both set is the very very close now
the brother and sister that I grew up with several James there's only 10 miles
between them so they kind of had a connection of being twins
even though they're not twins but they were born in the same year
it and there's like six seven years difference between cars so they always
did things together and I was always gone and I can't have always felt left
out because while they were going through their teenagers I was still a
kid
by the time I got into my teenagers they were grown up and gone so i can spend a
lot of time on my own which as a teenager and you've got siblings it
it's kind of hard when you see you to all disciplines that got such a
connection and thank you wish that you had that even though my big sis the
server she did everything that that she was supposed to do as a big sister to
keep me involved but as through think that that played a part in my depression
I kind of felt like I grew up as an only child that kind of carried on and as I
got older the more knowledge that came about about being gave one being he
actually was in the more I tried to deny the more depressed it made me feel
because I felt like I was being a fraud and I was lying in and I always thought
that I would never be able to be the person I was the person I am
it was between eating I was 18 and is now
scene and I think this is where my depression took a turn for the worst and
I found some stuff out about my family
the could potentially blow my family apart but only I knew and it told me
apart because i always think that maybe I could have stopped it
I'm not now that there's no way i could've door because it was a certain
person in my father's decision but I knew about it from the beginning and it
was always that I can't see it because obviously my family watches this then
no just cause problems and but with that going on in the back of my head annoying
that this could probably be a bomb within my family while I was watching my
sister take it like take care of my niece he was in hospital for five months
and feeling so helplessly
my sister is my best friend she's she's my world and to watch her not leave
money set aside for 5 mom's without breaking and then I never saw my sister
groans but she's the strongest person in the world and this was in the april i
went back to college in the sep tember when i was 18 i was to the musical
theater and it was about three months in this is when I knew that something was
wrong because my singing teacher support me as I and I love college college with
the best days of my life it was a place that I could sing dance act and just
forget about my life like I was the first one in the last one at all
so different to school I absolutely adored it
and then this was my final year and I see me to pour me out of class and she
said that's all he was wrong
we are the teachers have been talking and stuff for your concern
we have not seen your smiles and she came back and you know when you can feel
that that pressure in urine lake literally like a government's about to
break it that way is by all of my efforts to keep what this thing was like
from getting Syrian try and keep it secret
when my teacher said that to me it kind of felt like all of my efforts were
worthless because my depression had somehow found its way through all these
cracks that had been called by my family and it seems his way in to the one thing
that made me happy
I didn't know how to deal with that because i felt ashamed of myself that
allowed it to when I thought that I was such a strong person you know my mom
always says that I've got heart of stone and I'm hard as nails
you know I always thought that I would never let something like that get to me
and it did and it took away
part of my happiness and so after that conversation
I went and spoke to one of the mean to you as he's been with mrs. i was 14 when
I got put on the program and and she took me into this is our room and she
said sure that what's going on she thought that it was just something about
college and I turn around and I literally
it felt like I had shattered into a million pieces on the floor because I'd
held all of this in for so long since April and I not taught one single person
how I was feeling or what was going on inside my head and I just let it all go
and that's when I realized that my sadness wasn't just being sad
it was something that with people and she sat down and had a meeting with some
of the other cheaters and
nobody keeps an eye on man I started going to counseling lessons while I was
not lessons but counseling sessions while i was in college you know they
really they really looked out for me right
that Christmas was a different story
this thing that I tried to keep to myself
blue over Christmas and my family fell to bit and it was also do with facebook
facebook basically mom and dad have been together
well they had been together for 22 years and because of facebook that Christmas
I watched my mom walked down the road in the middle of the night and I was there
for in my pajamas running down the street screaming and begging her not to
leave me with my dad and she left me anyway
and for the first time in a very long time we know when I went back to the
hours I saw my sister crying
my sister doesn't cry I didn't even know that she won't eat dogs
I saw my dad breakdown and and the youngest in the family like I've always
kind of been looked after by my siblings and that for me was a point that took a
nose dive because we always felt like I was kind of in a way lucky that my
parents are still together for so long because in this generation are not these
things together and at that moment in time as well as watching my family break
I felt like I just become a part of another cyst statistic
like I was another child from a broken
home that's what it felt like my parents tried to work it out for a year
afterwards and they tried to do family things but we're not that type of family
anyway and it just felt so forced it when they say she's a it on now bored
very quickly before I when you was kind of a chance to catch our breath and I
left College that following in and I went in to do a production of Oliver and
then I went on to all doing a bunch of words no way I spin that Christmas and
that new years eve away from my house just because Christmas now kind of hold
er bud about place in my heart because of what happened
it's just a reminder of a broken family that can't really be together anymore
the way that we were and it was three days after new years eve 2009 keywords
and just turned 22
and I was on the train home from bolton and I read my mom and I said can you
make sure that the back doors unlocked because i don't have my key
I'm my mom told me
no I mean our and I was confused that did it all going on out there what you
mean she was I have left I've got my own hours
I know that will have its issues i I'm not telling you
and then she put the phone down and I did here for my mom for about two months
and i found out that she was only down the gold and not owe me and my dad have
never gone
he's always pulling me is always had something against me and it's always
been jealous of the fact that I've kind of always been a woman's go
these are my dad's been a very abusive mine
I've watched him beat my brothers and my sisters and then taken beans myself far
for a father to leave me with my dad was something I didn't quite know how to
handle because we use the laugh and joke about it when I was going not saying
shall we just parked on by now and leave and the fact that she is left without me
and not even bother to tell me and didn't tell me where she was
Leigh literally destroyed meant but I always thought she was a she
take me with them and I went home to my dad's house and I walked in the foot
human i saw my dad just in a ball crying and I have never seen my dad cry my dad
has always been the kind of firm
stiff chocolate pipeline and always
I was never allowed to cry going up it was weakness
I didn't know what to do
I'm from not that day on I kind of don't want to be there I applied to go to you
just to get out of the house and that state you know I used to be my sister
every night and I was going back home to her for a bit and because my dad used to
sleep from night or four in the morning and then it got to work so I kind of you
start trying to work my day so I didn't have to see you
the time I spin along
just me and my dad made my depression even worse because i was with a month I
didn't like among the bully men and all the conflicts and other confrontations
that used to have with my mom had not been passed to me and I didn't know how
like it was like living with a stranger and I remember my best friend at the
time crystal came to my house and she said some it i've been researching
online and I think that we need to take you to the doctor because I think you've
got the impression at the time I was setting the box and I remember thinking
I just want
I ever put in my head above the water and thinking actors what mr. and I can't
deal with this and I got all we gott dressage to be so doctors and I was the
north of depression then at 20 and they put me on antidepressants what do you
mean we saw ill and I just I stopped taking my thought no i don't i don't
want to do this it will go away like that
the year past makes such a big event happened with my dad that I don't want
to talk about it cause me to leave and the police came and got me out of the
house
I left that night this was three years ago and I've never seen or spoken to my
dad sins and never want to
I never wanted in my life and then we do with my mom
let's just say it probably got better because other meal is how broken mind
homes with asian shit was it was
I don't know how to say it but she turned out not to be the person that I
thought she was you know I always thought that if she needed me should be
there like but mentally mom wasn't she doesn't understand my depression and she
was open start there and then it was 2012 and I gotten into the National
Youth film academy tradition in chester oh it's as much as the workshop for two
weeks and i met an amazing girl called ebook and as soon as I saw it I knew I
was gay because it was literally like love at first sight
she she was so beautiful and in that sweet process is when and oh I she
stayed at my house and I guess that and it was that moment I knew that I was gay
and it's a refinement and I was terrified to be gay and the people with
incomes gay
what I love this girl
beyond beyond anything
she was the best thing that had ever come into my life and still to this day
because we're still friends was still just as close as we are as we were then
well we obviously haven't been together for two years but she's still a massive
piece of my life
it was hard because I was so scared of people thinking that I was gay that I
kept a secret
and I literally had a secret relationship with her and for once my
depression couldn't touch me because the look that I had for evil was stronger
than anything even my depression
I I felt completely safe around she's the only person that has in my in my
entire life that ever made me feel like nothing going on
and I have trouble sleeping at night because they have nightmares and i can
still remember this
she's the first person whose arms
I have a fell asleep when I was literally lay on top of her and I fell
asleep while she just called me and i have never done I sins and it was it was
hard because I wanted to I wanted to show her off to the world and short show
everybody that i found this amazing girl and I was in love with her and I just
quit and thought that was literally the last time I ever remember being truly
truly up it was when i was with her that was the same year that i audition for
the city and I got the part of a leash man holds got the part and had to be
able to Scotland at the end of august which wasn't the best of situations
because obviously i lived in manchester evil in Birmingham
<operand> twenty </operand> and i have to go to Glasgow which port another
hundred miles between us that film in the end of august could sense that
things where God with me and Eva and interrupt or we broke all because the
distance was too much for you play
she needed somebody there with the which I understand you
some people need physical contact for it to be a relationship i remember i sat in
my room in glasgow and I remember that feeling of when my teacher said to me we
have not seen you smile
I remember that feeling much as just literally surgery not my body and it was
if you imagine like a shadow
it was literally like a shadow always just in golf in me and I had to go to
work the next day feel remember sit and all I did was cry at every play
I couldn't think of anything I kept screwing lines I couldn't concentrate in
my scenes i was just hard all could and it was my first experience of heartbreak
because she was the first of a person I loved then I finished film in the
october state the November because it was my birthday and 3d before my
birthday
even told me that she'd started seeing someone else and that's still not being
home and seen a properly and spoken about and the moment that she told me i
was in attacks here on the way to one of the other cast members house and answer
get the taxi driver to start well i got all gave him on it and I just dominated
industry and I just is kind of like a blur to me that moment because it was
literally like time stood still and again it was that that feel of a
horrible - uh door just overcoming men
I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep I didn't enjoy my birthday
I was going out for a meal with all the cast and we call it sharp because I just
couldn't concentrate i just sat in the car park when we got home in my friend's
car and just soft and I stopped four days and i came home and that was the
moment that my depression was on its way down to rub on that Christmas
I met you a few days before Christmas before my birthday whenever it was we
said our goodbyes need the rubble wanting to single by we've also in the
car and ride it took was ages to actually like let go of each other is
able by and I remember watching her drive away and actually feel in my heart
break and that for me was the point that I think broke me and made it so easy for
my depression to to get to like get worse
I lost way equity sleep i moved back in with my mom
well I didn't move back in I was like it there while it was Christmas and store
and it just got worse and I just felt like the longest person in the load
I quit I didn't want to see anybody I couldn't speak to people i couldn't talk
on the phone because it was a secret because it was a secret relationship and
I hadn't come out
I couldn't tell anybody why I was so sad
oh my i just told everybody that I didn't feel well and
this is carried on into februari and I remember being a mom spared you my name
back and I could have been a boyfriend in the union is watching telly and they
were laughing and joking and I just I felt I I was in so much pain and then i
have lost the best thing in the world that I didn't feel like I could live
without and I had a headache all day and I was convinced i just need to go put
the killers and I when a tall one warm
I was going to in a charger from my house clean my car drove to my house
took all the piracy get more out of that out the covered and I went and SAT on
the bathroom floor
I said go by text to everybody and that was the first time I attempted suicide
as well Lord 50
and I don't remember much over the feeling my body go cold
the next thing that I name
I was at the bottom of the stairs I don't know how it got there but I woke
up like I had fallen
the next thing that I remember but i was i have visions of being an ambulance
with people put in a mask on my face and putting cuts on my arms and then the
next bit that i can remember i was in a hospital room and there was a nurse
either side of me
he was putting dripped into my arms because apparently my board had already
started to form because of the policy tomorrow is a lot of it all
well just over a week
they said that if the ambulance got there late i want to die
well I always late I was being sick and I needed to see it all because i was
being sick was always being sick is that
chalk it and as I child I could feel something going to my throw this all the
nurses we're trying to like find my back to get it our and as always sick all
these blood came op and there's about this piece size of the line of muscle
milk and taking that many policies and other
I practically belong my stomach lining apart
islamic not meant to do with that any drugs and I went in under sunday night
normal came and saw me on
in the afternoon and she burst into tears because i was laying on this water
to drink to my arms oxygen of mine or yours
i was paying all my eyes or purple
she thought that when when the heart beats one because she thought that might
crash my car was gone and I mean I didn't have to live
total what happened until she came to the hospital because i'm not over 18
I have to give my consent for her to know what was going on and she sat down
next to me and she said beginning to do it and I said here and she said why and
that was the first time that I ever admit to somebody that I wasn't happy
I'm gonna start crying in my mom started crying and we will do when i came out of
hospital I went into a program that's called the at the crisis enactus team in
common see you once a week they put me on a lot of medication but the
medication that they put me on the first time out maybe so
Paulie I think it was something like search really it just turned me into his
army
I couldn't II i couldn't sleeve
I was a nervous wreck
I developed a trauma LOL i was shaking all the time and they try be on a lot of
different medications cause if you don't know there were so many different sides
of medications for depression
there's some people whose bodies react with the goods so kindness on people who
don't
it's walk oh my i also find the right ones for me because a lot of the
medications
sometimes the trial and error but you have to stay on them for lake at least
two weeks to see how they work and the tumblers that they put me on either made
me nauseous gave me a trim I gave me a migraine
when you're in the axis and crisis team is a therapist and a wholeness that
comes and checks on your at your house rather than you having to come out
because after you attempt suicide didn't you come home and you realize the
aftermath is like all of your senses and your depression and wednesday is equal
to an extreme level
I know I was terrified to leave my room let alone go out of the house and I
became so clingy to mom
I literally kind of moved into this child that just needed a mom
this is nose had to and is there is to it was trying to figure out why I don't
want it
we're trying to explain to my mom and almost by finding my family like what
depression is how it affects people like how it's going to affect me the fact
that i needed to sleep
you know and I probably wants that you regularly so let me sleep if and when I
sleep
try and keep me more of a bit because anybody who suffers from depression
it is so hard to wake up in the morning that along our bed and get dressed and I
think I spend at least two want in my pajamas but yeah with my mom like a bee
I i cling to her but I was like a three-year-old child like anywhere that
she went I went with her she went into the kitchen i'm going to time in the
kitchen with us she had a bath that sit at the edge of the box and for about
three months
i selected met with my mom because I was terrified of being on my own
even just leave it on my own I had night as and I was then they ignored and
post-traumatic stress which was all to do with the way that my dad treated me
and the things that darn and it just affected me in ways that I didn't know
it had and it had suppressed everything
and once you like for me that suicide was like pressing release button and it
was like opening the floodgates and everything that ever gone wrong in my
life was there and it was like having to face it and it was like one fight after
another with everything after my suicide I kind of had a realization
it was in March month after many tournaments and then decided and I knew
it was time for me to come all and I remember being the SAP
in in this better you right not this text thinking am I ready
so these all these people all these people that have shown what you love me
but how can I like to do now
Anderson is sexed out that was basically say in what's been going on how i feel
and i was gay but you didn't change your was always gay and sent it and the
response was overwhelming
like a lot of people said that they knew some people will tell they're okay
my grandparents were remaining my granddad is my favorite person in the
world I don't think my nana has ever hurt me so much then she did - are after
coming out and she told me that she she looked beyond that I want and for me
that was everything because they were the people that it's all glass because I
was terrified of losing him
then after a while like mom just thought that I was being lazy
she didn't on the machine still doesn't understand that my depression is here
and it's real because I can have good days and bad days and that kind of worst
days and she doesn't understand that she thinks that I'm sleeves it then I don't
do anything
I don't do anything to help myself when I go to hospital every week I see my
doctor every week like I do
add it as that I couldn't cognitive therapy
this was all in 2013
I met my second girlfriend that summer we used together from july open till
Christmas beginning of the relationship with amazing a thought she was the most
amazing girl in the world like she may be like she made me happy she was
I thought she was everything I wanted and because i was our I didn't feel the
need to hide or and I shoulder off to the world to move you follow me we'll
remember she was funny and she's beautiful she i literally worship the
ground she walks on what we do our relationship
I started to realize that she couldn't deal with my depression and it got very
nicely very quickly and when we split off
we were still kind of friends you know she's i was at don't do anything for a
ball
I knew that something was going on between her my best friend at the time
and that fog that shadow that I talked about came back and it came back in full
force
I just felt like every bit of trust that i left in this world had gone and I was
a mug and is this going to be the way that everybody treats Millie is this my
depression is it's all on worth like I'm I just here for everybody's like to play
with this is is this all the life we've got to offer minute and I asked them
both if it was true you and me both line to buy and denied it and then you know
obviously finally came out to do it together and not anymore
and this was this year
share this anymore because they'd like to be for so long and when that happens
all your self-worth disappears because you just feel a while i was there not
worth the truth
I loved that girl and to be treated the way that I was and like -
and especially betrayed by so one that i share my secrets with and it's about it
that I cried to you about my girlfriend
we call clock for her to be then be with my girlfriend my ex-girlfriend
it broke me into pieces
literally didn't know who to trust and it was in September rushed in the I
couldn't take the pain anymore my relationship with my mom was breaking
down
I found out about all these lies I literally just felt like my whole life
wasn't worth living in
because it was just filled with so much pain and then took another overdose and
i ended up biking must be all and i ended up back at square one
luckily I wasn't on my own this time I had my girlfriend with me at the time
and my best friend
so you supported me throughout and everybody else that was there it was a
lot different from the first attempt because there is more people that were
concerned and when I came out of us all then the next day I knew that somethin
in me changed and it's very true
this day in the paint changes because it does and it got worse
the release mount my mom my relationship broke down and I was homeless for two
months as David my best friend stayed with us is them until i got my own flat
and which have now been in nearly three months
ever since sep tember and knowing that something had changed
it's been a lot harder because i felt myself surrender the depression and when
you get to that point where you feel like you're only here for depression and
you
you sit for hours and you wonder why this is your life like why is everybody
else was able to be happy
like what's wrong with me why can't I be happy
it literally drives you insane and the problem with me is that when i get to a
point where my depression is getting the better of me
I push everybody away and isolate myself and I spend too much time on my own and
I think myself into oblivion and that's when I become dangerous to myself this
is the whole reason why I open this video because you can't deal with
depression on your own
it will destroy you is destroying me
depression right now has cost me a lot like I've been some big prices for it
it's cause met a really good relationship that I had with a reason go
and Alex that had to end it because I knew the having the disease that I do I
couldn't mentally be the girlfriend that she needed like she's an amazing girl
and she deserves somebody the country or like that and I couldn't because my
brain is so dark and just clouded with negativity and it is it's hard for me to
get open the morning and live and to do that and try and have a relationship and
a successful one
I couldn't do and it isn't fair to her and it wasn't fair to me because I was
putting too much pressure on myself
you know i wasn't being there for her and I wasn't being a girlfriend
I was becoming a decade and is also caused me my best friend because I've
been so up to be my depression and let it get away with that
anybody that tries to help me I'll push him away including my best friend and
she's actually the one person in the world the good fight my corner through
anything
even if I was in the wrong she would still be on my side and I just have
neglected urban this is what depression does it cooks off the people that you
love and the people that care about you more than it looks like this glass bar
here in front of you and people can see your people could take a look at your
book you can meet child and it is the hardest thing to do as someone that
suffers from depression and mental illness to ask for help but I am Telling
You is so many of its suffering from it badly that you need to ask for help even
if it is just to say I'm not doing so good
I'm not happy like don't let it cost a life because it costs me my life and a
lot more and I've kind of got to apply it where I know that I'm probably always
going to have depression but like it's up to me to fight for my happiness
because nobody owes can do for you nobody else gets them in your shoes
feel what you feel people feel it on different levels i have chronic
depression that literally controls my day in
and day out life I don't sleep regularly
I can't eat properly I can't do simple things like also the shop because I'm
I'm terrified of having a breakdown when someone talks to me
actually someone that was to come in and say so for you okay i would probably
break it down into pieces because it just it just makes you feel old and that
you don't have anybody when there are probably a lot of people that care about
you and that's the hardest thing because then you start if you give it and you
feel like a bird
and that's how I feel way to any of the people that know me
the watching this like you always say also going to be you know that don't
your book when you feel like a burden is not easy and all you want to do is be by
yourself
and it's which is that the only companion that you have in your life is
your depression
sure and there are a few books that I've read that kind of help mutinous done is
for one of them is called the power of now by Eckhart Tolle it is an amazing
spiritualist and he explains what pain is
and it's called a pain but it and it's literally like another the person and is
the best way that I could ever explain to someone with it
what depression feels like and how sometimes it's a comfort and is the only
normal is a bit you know and this is a sad sad truth and it hurts to admit it
what is the true coming home and get any bed and crying could somehow in a very
weird way I feel confident because it's the one thing that you know is always
going to be there like my depression
like I said this made me lose so many people you always made me have multiple
buyers than hellos and is the one thing in my life that is consistent and that
was a sad thing to admit that the only thing that is consistent in my life is
pain and heart and unhappiness but i have bring it out to sit here and tell
you that you do not have to suffer alone
you really don't if you can talk to your GP I make sure that your GP on the
standard and if they don't you ask for another one
don't feel that you're finding your doctor because I had to do it
I change doctors and i found the best doctor ever
she gets me shit like if I need her and she will make sure that i am in the
surgery within the half hour
I have an amazing therapies team who are the hospital and I ever notice that
anchor ring
24 7 if I need to lay your friends if you feel you can trust them and that
there will be there for you
then talk to them don't push them away because trust me when you lose them
it hurt and it makes it a lot words to feel late
you've pushed out the young
only good thing that you are don't isolate yourself because that's the
worst thing that you can do and then always hard to believe me but as much as
it's hard for yourself because this is what this is all about you got to find
you got to fight in depression and don't don't go down as a bit too
don't let it take your hostage because it will bring your life you've got to
find and even if that is just going for a walk
going from one put and I put your ipod in so that you're not with your thoughts
because it can still get you in your suit in that will take your focus away
from few inside if you can like try your best not to stay on tablets with you
long I've been on tablets for three years and literally
I don't know what my personality is anymore because I I hate being on
tablets and take so much
but if you cannot get out and exercise and be active you won't need tub looks
because your body was that producing the chemicals itself
I take the vaccine which is an auntie person and I tell you 300
milligrams of it i think is up the clone which is asleep in <day> sixth </day>
I'd hate going out of the palm which is for anxiety which is M is kind of like a
common topic at a power on and then I have all different type like kind of
pain killers because even though it's a mental illness it will affect you
physically you you let it
they keep you let me drain your energy and make you stay in bed all day all I
sit in one place or the time it will start to affect you let my back aches my
bones and my hair is falling out because my skin is a man like my nails a broad
came because it stops your appetite stops you from moving it literally stops
you from living and it just makes you feel that your existed
so I think that I probably run it on and off and i'm here to tell you that you
don't have to show for long
and you can message me on tumblr
if you need me like I won't reply
I'll answer any questions i'll post links in the description below two
things I know things
- what helped me but if you're watching this and you saw almond any of this
release to you just know what that you can you can do this if I can do it you
can do it and if you don't feel like it can do and you want to do it with you
and you can let you can probably see I'm not wearing me a call
I'm in my pajamas because i want you to see me like this is what people actually
look like The Crying the few things and they don't wear makeup everyday
some people do some what I love it and it's hard but you know how long that a
lot of people that are willing to help you but you've got to be willing to help
himself
and that's the main thing don't be a victim to it and don't allow yourself to
be convicted
you've got this is that standing off for mental illness and helping each other
