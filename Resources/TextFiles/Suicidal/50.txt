supposed to be to each other

me and it hurt me both physically and mentally and was already going through
my hair and separation which had officially haven't yet instead lead-in
officially 1 pages fought back i was tired of these girls of the scripture
leaders and they would consciously to be going in the hallways and reset
everything they would just me and push me up against a wall but they were doing
in a way that they knew that they would I got the thing where I officially
officially transferred to use peer instruction to clarify my dad was with
