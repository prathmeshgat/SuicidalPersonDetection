hospital for months basically and where
wait I'm getting up yeah basically I'm just going to be talking about like my
life leading up to the time I was like admitted into the mental hospital
and by the way guys do you like many background and I like decorated and
decorated decorated decorated
I decorated and I what this might be a little bit like confusing and hard to
understand because I mean I'm really shit at explaining things and stuff like
that so i hope you guys like kind of get what i'm trying to say in in this story
ok
what weight whether i stopped um basically I've like suffered with i
don't know if you guys know this if I've spoken about on my channel or anything
yet but I've suffered with like severe anxiety depression and PTSD like since I
was a little kid
so I've always have to kind of deal with that and yeah basically when I was 13
years old
I'm really bad at explaining i think i just like jump to hold it so I suffer
with like anxiety and PTSD depression and stuff like that which kind of messed
up my childhood in a way you know like I I was too scared to go out i had panic
attacks every morning before school
this is all because of like posturing events and stuff like that from when i
was little i think i had just had that teen and I just started
you're right out of high school I think I don't even remember a lot of this but
basically i just woke up one morning with like a really bad panic attack by
the way I don't remember this i have like blocked it out
like I don't remember this is just from like what my mom has told me and and I i
remember a little bit of things but I've kind of looked at me I just wake up one
morning with like a really really bad panic attack request and above a hat is
crying screaming and I just I mean I think my mom and my auntie with that and
i just said to them like I don't want to live anymore i don't want to do this
I want to die like I don't want to live anymore I can't be here this is too hot
like I was freaking out
going a little bit crazy apparently i got like a knife or something but
anyways I was either going to remember this is just from what my mom's told me
and i got like a knife and I was having a panic attack crying saying that i want
to die like I want to kill myself
I don't I can't do I can't deal with this anymore you know so
so that was the day that I had dropped out of school like that was the last day
i had ever been in like that was the last day i was gonna be like mainstream
schooling and stuff like that because I just couldn't cope with it after that my
mom got me a therapist that can help deal with like my anxiety and depression
and all that kind of stuff
sorry so I found therapist and I started walking with her but I still having like
really bad panic attacks and I could like I didn't even want to ever go
outside because I was really scared because of my anxiety and stuff add a
little salsa
I was really depressed so I would just kind of like United stay in bed on a
full day and not want to do anything that was depressed and I was only 13 you
know and then a year went by so because i was 14 when me my mom and my arms he
decided to move to England
so we moved to England when I was fourteen you know I was still suffering
anxiety obviously still not in school and all that kind of stuff about like a
week we were there for like a week or a week or two I don't like I remember
not exactly no i'm not exactly sure but i think we would have like a week or
maybe two weeks
I don't know this is when things got really really bad like i was I just felt
so unsettled so anxious because obviously i was in a whole new country
with new people new places i was like my anxiety was just like
way up that like I thought I was gonna die anyways one day I my auntie is on
medication for like a few things but she's like a lot of medication and one
day I got out there I remember it was morning but I don't quite remember
exactly what happened
also this is just from like what my mom has told me so my throat is really dry
him like I thought I was done with live like I i just wanted to get just get out
of life I didn't want to be here anymore
so anxious or depressed I was not happy obviously so I i got all of I don't know
where my mom my auntie were but they want them
I got all my aunties meds like it was a lot of meds and it was like high doses
crazy meds like Sarah cool and stuff like that which is like you know you
shouldn't take it if you don't need to take it or you could get really hurt but
I took them because i didn't want to live anymore sorry i just got a whole
bunch of them like a lot and I got some kind of alcoholic armament what it was
but anyways I stuff i mean i don't actually remember it but obviously I
would have liked started taking the meds and stuff like that and then apparently
my mom walked in on me and i had i don't know how i got i don't remember how many
meds I taken but it was a lot because I started getting really drowsy and like I
don't know I don't know if I was like I couldn't walk for police and stuff like
that and that's all I remember and then apparently my mom called the ambulance
and the police were there as well and they took me to the hospital and I was
in like just general hospital not the mental hospital yeah i was just in
general hospital for that three days while I just like slept the whole time
because all the medication that I took and obviously just not gonna be happy
like i was going i just slept then all these psychiatrists and stuff like that
came to like assess me and see how my mental health was doing like I don't
remember any of that
apparently they thought I was unstable to be like unstable
apparently they thought I was unstable so they had to admit me
into mental hospital but i didn't i didn't want to go this so i was like
saying nor I'm not going i refused to go
so then I section to me that means like that means you have to go no matter what
like no matter what you say or your parents say like you have to go to a
mental hospital if your section and yeah and then I went into the mental hospital
and I wasn't obviously i was in the adolescent unit i was 14 at that time
and so they were all people were like other patients they're the same like
similar age around me you know obviously they were also kind of unstable in a way
and i remember getting that and I was more scared I remember I was crying and
everything like that so it was this very scary for me
I was so scared that I did not eat anything for like three or four days
literally I couldn't eat I was too anxious to eat like I could not eat so I
didn't get anything anything at all like three or four days as I was there for
four months but I did meet so many nice people that I you know like I met such
strong people don't really remember a lot and nothing much happened like it's
so boring in there or you do is you do like therapy groups and stuff like that
you got to take your meds and all that kind of stuff but that's it like
everything's like looked up you have to do they do you like 10 minutes checks on
you like every 10 minutes they have to like see what you're doing and write
down what you're doing that is basically it that's the story of how I've got into
a mental hospital and yes or four months later I will discharge me and my mom
decided to move back to Australia
