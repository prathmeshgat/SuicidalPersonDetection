so for about a month now I've been putting off this video because I was
afraid of the backlash I was going to get I just kind of concerned with what
the outcome of it would be
I don't really know how to start this because if you know me pretty well you
know I'm not really a serious person
a lot of you know I guess that you know I've pretty much been bullied my entire
life like there wasn't really hear that someone left me alone
I was kind of just always the target which is fine you know
boeing is a thing that happens this particular thing
it changed me it broke me and it almost ended me the reason I want to talk about
this is because if someone hears about what I went through and realizes that
while she got through it
she is ok and she is making it past that awful time in her life
then maybe I can help save someone's life I realized that some people are
going to look at this video and be like wow she's just looking for attention
looking for abuse that that's fine
you can think whatever you want but for me personally if I even think for a
second that I can help someone
I'm putting this out there then I'm going to do it and I'm not going to care
what anyone says any more about it
ok so it's a four year of high school started out fine
I had just transferred back into my old high school from being at another high
school for like two months and like it
I went back to my old high school at the beginning of the year I saw this guy so
I was like well you know he's really attractive but i don't think you love
you talk to me about March he had leaked asked me for my number over Instagram or
something so I gave it to him because I like yeah you're attractive you know
and let's just call him Luke
yeah we'll just call Luke for the sake of identity on
so luke and I start talking and it is about a week where we started talking
and he asked me if i wanted to hang out with him
after school again that's fine and I'll stay after school with you
and so made up after school when I really excited because he's really
attractive to me at this point and turns out he was a freshman but that doesn't
really bother me because I was like a attractive guy of these nice to meet you
so it's cool
and he had a friend with him he's like hey is it cool
my friends out with this all I catcher fine whatever
and so we went to the park because the way it was structured the park next to
the school building so we went there after everyone left some things happened
that I'm not proud of and i'm not going to go to into detail but I had ended up
alone in a bathroom
with use two guys
and I felt very pressured to do something that I had never done before
then after that they were like oh well we have to go now and I was like okay
that's fine too
I called my mom like okay I down was to drive and so i'll pick me up everything
was ok kinda was like what did I just do but I didn't talk to anyone about it of
course i had a few friends that have warned me not to hang out with him and I
didn't listen
this was a week before my birthday my 16th birthday
you just kind of got really distant was being really mean to me
so his friend one of his really good friends
we'll just call through why not so drew confident me
you know he's like a do you wanna hang out Drew had lived next to my friend
I'll call her Rachel
yeah just call him regional so through and Rachel have lived close by each
other so I was like oh you know that's fine I'll go hang out with Drew and
Rachel forever thing
that'll be what I do drew and I had some time alone because Rachel went home she
left
Luke from before was at his house with a bunch of his friends and he had called
me and he's like hey come over
no I with someone and he's like oh who are you with
he kept asking me and asking me and asking me and then he called Drew and
drew into his phone and hurt me in the background
he's like he's like okay both of you think over and I was like who's over
there
it's like others but like 20 guys like oh no thank you
my mother is picking me up soon I'm good and there are a bunch of people and
background and like tell that's not take it over here
get that door over here now stop being a bitch
come over hang out it'll be fine
I was so shocked and I kinda just hung up the phone
don't talk to me you know
and my mom picked me up we're going to the grocery store we are at the grocery
store and I got a call from him and he's like Kay
seriously come over I was like oh no we bring an awful and I'm not coming over
and we're not hanging out and that's it
so we got into an argument and he told me he's like well don't be such a bitch
to me because i have a video of what happened and I kind of was just like
yeah right whatever like bye and hung up the phone and it will be government and
then I walked in a school that following monday and there were people staring at
me
you know when you walk into a room and you can just feel that people are
talking about you
that's how i felt everywhere I went I . it was walking down the hall went into
the bathroom after school and walked out and I heard it's cool guys and I
I will never forget what they said they said hey you're a tailor and he's like
Oh which taylor
oh yeah the short Taylor that we had a class with an 8th grade
he's like yeah why because yeah haven't you heard she's such a slut
will do basically anything that anyone and adjust
walk past them
they saw me and option
so this kind of went on for a while and for a while people would ask me hate you
so much
oh yes i know so and so hey are you the girl from the video yes I girl from the
video that was my life I had drama at school and I had dropped my home because
we couldn't get my grades up because I was so distracted and there were a bunch
of guys started getting a lot of attention from guys and for a while I
kind of liked it was like you know what
it's fine it's whatever this happened i'm moving on
I'll talk to all these guys it will be good
so that's my dentist are talking to a bunch guys at this time I kinda just
went with it
I was so dumb I started wearing really really low-cut tops and really really
push up bras and caring about my parents school and I still continue to get a lot
of attention from guys
there were a lot of workers any guy that I was friends with or talking to you
have sex with me
I was known for sleeping with my teachers to get my grades up when in
fact my grades were still awful and I had all female teachers so and the claim
was that I had all male teachers because I switched so i can sleep with my
teachers
I would go to bed and just cry myself to sleep every night and didn't want to
talk to anyone
there was one person that I talked to at school and actually cared to talk to
trusted and she's still my best friend
to this day without her I would not be here
honestly I would not have made it out of sophomore year it was the end of the
year and i had started talking to Luke from before because I was naive i
started an unhealthy pattern with him where if he apologized and I believed it
out and start talking again
I for some reason thought I could trust him and anytime that anything was said
anytime anything sent it was shown to a lot of people
so we got into an argument one day school after school in front of everyone
he kind of tried to make me feel inferior like I was job like I could do
anything like I would never be able to get past him
so I told him you know what I'm done
this will be the last time that we speak never coming back to just stood there
with a smirk just kind to me and said you'll never be done and you will always
come back and I just roll my eyes left and I have talked to him since there
were still people that knew about the video video was still there
frasier it's still there and i kind of just got used to that
to be honest it's something that I did I have to accept it and I'm not getting
anyone else involved in this
I'll just let it be I started getting my grades up a little and started kind of
trying to move on and started talking to this
you guy who was super sweet he was so different from all the gods that year
and we went to the springs with a friend that I made and his friends on the
weekend
it was great I had a good time and we decided to go into this restricted area
so we went there we were by ourselves just talking stuff
his friends my friends were up on the hill above us
then something hit me
literally had me and it was a rock a rock and I was rushed to the fire
department across the street because we were about half an hour away from my
house my parents were able to like reach me my parents didn't even know I was
there to be honest and I was brush to the fire department they were concerned
that i have lost my eyesight was rushed in an ambulance to the yard
my parents were able to be contacted my dad Kane an opthamologist examine my
eyes and you know you're going to need surgery
your irises torn you may lose your eyesight a lot of tests were run on my
head because it was determined as a head trauma
some doctors are concerned and my parents I'm might not even be able to
live anymore i mean
site it's just really scary situation after the opthamologist examined me
I was rushing another ambulance to the
Florida State Hospital there I was prepped for surgery can eat anything I
can drink anything and my eye is still
this stuff because my people is larger than this one because my restore the
first time I had seen my i was when i came home the following Sunday it
happened on friday i can and i was first
I just remember breaking down and I couldn't stop crying because I was so
concerned with my books
not even the pain but I my entire life
I loved my eyes my honest are or were my favorite thing about myself
they were really the only thing that I felt made me special
they were the only thing that kind of gave me a little bit of confidence
because I've never been really confident in myself
so just the fact that that had been ripped away from me overwhelmed me
so kind of sucks happened after i got back from the hospital
I was in recovery for a while and i spent a lot of time on Twitter
one night I came across one of those exposing thoughts pages for risk
yeah
- pictures of and a confession of
what had happened earlier year
I
kind of felt
broken again
I mean I was in recovery for something that almost killed me and then I had to
deal with this again in that moment everything kind of just flooded back to
the way it was
every memory from the past year overwhelmed me and I felt so trapped
tears just came in
I got a bunch of texts from people some people i had barely talked to some
people I don't even know your texting me asking is this you is this you was that
about you
is that true and it was just like everything
flash before my eyes I
went into the bathroom locked the doors
brand really really hot
yeah
yeah
for the first time
took a blade to my wrist just kept cutting cutting until running out of
space
this true
watching
so
thinking that at least the pay for everything that happened was gone
every memory started to fade and I was just focused on pain of that moment I
didn't care about anything else is going on
and I just what i wanted to keep doing it doing it doing it
stop
just SAT there
sticking
what
gosh
and I just hoped i looked up close
yeah
good
now
i SAT there for a few
ok
and for some reason it didn't end
still here for a while
that actually continued every now and then I would carry something in my purse
like nail clippers or something
any time I felt pain or anyone said anything or someone said something on
Twitter
there was a text message about it I would just take the Clippers to my skin
and
sit back
watch all the pain
transfer from
head
I couldn't stop and I didn't tell anyone
I really don't know how I start honestly but for a while
all I wanted to do was die
I see your point
yeah
living life and see myself
doing anything see myself going out with friends
he isolated myself for a while talk to my parents
yeah
I just
consumed by
this feeling of pain and hurt and how everything was just piled piled on
one day
just kind of got a little better
day
I kept getting a little better eventually opened up about some things
to people that I trusted and
help me work through my problems in order for you to get better
you have to surround yourself with people that will support you no matter
what
I know this video was extremely different from what people are used to
seeing from me
