hey guys it's the Lodi and so this week
is Mental Health Awareness Week and I thought I betrayed you my story with
mental illness
the first time I tried to go through this video I was jumbled and almond
place and kept breaking down and crying and so I thought I would try again so
that you could actually understand what I was saying
so often times I feel like when you go for your daily lives
a lot of people are shrugging internally and trying to put on a brave face when
people ask how are you see they're good okay and if it's not it's very
uncomfortable for most people and so even the other day I saw somebody posted
a status about how they were having a bad day and that they didn't want you
know to be upset or sure that they were upset because we might ruin somebody
else's day and all that's true you have a lot of times we just have to be okay
with not being okay
when you're always putting a brave face on eventually you're going to break down
and just gonna make things worse because you're not actually dealing with the
issues that are causing you to be unhappy in the United States 15 adults
with mental illness third leading cause of death among youth
h10 2024 is suicide and a large order of these people don't go and receive
treatment and professional help and so with me I've been chronically depressed
I have been presents the fourth grade I remember like my think of memories in
that time it's always like blue and purples and that's when I started kind
of acting out
home I was very bad child now because i'm just depressed and unhappy and a lot
of times you know what to tell my parents I professional help write a
little letter apologizing for my behavior and saying I need professional
help
so eventually when I always think in middle school we went and saw a
therapist but that first appointment and a lot of women during that time we went
in the woman she put her on the phone to put it on speaker and she was like I've
been a whole day is why i don't want to exit out in the middle all day and so
that put me off and really it's my first woman ever seeking talking to a
therapist or anybody like that and I think she wasn't giving current divided
attention by putting us on speaker phone
putting herself on speakerphone while we're there for anyone ever paid for and
so it's almost like talking in French to my mother and she was translating and
then the was upset with that but I was kind of upset because it was like how
are you doing some point we're going to be doing that and so we never went back
after that first appointment and so the next time is all therapist was last year
so last year was probably the worst that my depression had ever been
I had suicidal thoughts here and there throughout the years but this was like a
severe suicidal thoughts and something that kind of added pressure to this was
i started a new job
so most residence halls our dorms have always people don't those arms and
assistance and my school they also have class advocates for cas and initially
the program is it was theirs for african-american students and help them
navigate university and just have a support system of individuals who maybe
have some of the background to you and then change the program like they're
trying to be more inclusive and so I was open to all students but because of this
the program maybe they're kind of testing it out
the program was probably they were saying it was going to last year the
program is going to continue
so basically you know i'm at a job where a lot of people didn't know what I did
there like what i see a would have television co-workers didn't understand
and it was just this added pressure when you are a student of color and a problem
my institution pwi and you're queer student and then you're a woman and then
you're an immigrant all these things all these identities that make you a
minority and then you're in a job setting where your again marginalized
people don't take anything serious of what you're doing it just like so so
much pressure and another pressure was also that because I lived where I worked
so it's like you never got a break off and a lot of my job consisted of was
that twice a week for three hours each day so six hours we go into the
residence halls and on people's doors and makes me talk with them see how they
are going to see me support system and a lot of times
your accident people how they're doing how they're going and you're supporting
them when you're doing your own things and you don't feel like you have any
support system so the reason why they also do the reason why do you do it
looking at video for three years because I at the most already talked about a lot
of the things that I was dealing with so i would basically every day for two
months straight
I go to my room and I caught myself to sleep and it shows
and I felt I felt very low you know talk to my mother
most days but sometimes i just wanted some extra support and people who I
thought were going to be there for me and knew what I was going through just
one basically coming off and just like I don't care and doing with that where
people who you think are going to be there for you say you know
call me anytime or i'll be there for you and they just cut you off
that's what broke me and so I called like hot lines probably three times and
i finally decided that I was going to go and see more professional help
my experience as a child kind of turned me away because of the experience that I
stated before so I when I went to my University's a psychiatric dept that we
have and it was also struggle for that because you have to make the appointment
it was two days before the appointment or I want to actually sauce about it and
I was only an intake and when I went to the intake session
they said basically this is providing short-term help me Flo you have more
severe situation so we're going to work for you to have all signed hop and I
want to just break down and let go
I can't do this anymore what's the point I'm trying and then this office mess and
so they've heard me out
and one of the places because my schedule with my job and school I wasn't
able to go during the day I'm gonna be able to go at night and so there's only
one option that allows me to go at night time and so I went to this place and
make an appointment and found out it was a hundred twenty dollars per hour and I
was like I can't afford this
I'm gonna get people to sleep or calls and I guess he just a bit and four
dollars a month
how am I going to be able to for this eventually I worked it out my trends
I ended up getting six dollars a month and I want every week once a week so
that was two hundred forty dollars a month and so I had basically less than
two hundred dollars to like pay for food because my house is paid for and another
reason that was like pressure for me during that time was so many times I
wanted to leave that job
like so many times but I kept thinking about how we're going to pay for i'm
going to live and just think about how I felt kind of trap like I can't pay to
live anywhere else and like have a job to pay for right so that kind of also
like made me feel even boring
so like I couldn't get out of the situation but which one blog i stay
because the spring semester and doing the job a lot more but yeah just dealing
with the stress of my job and just feeling like I didn't have really any
close friends are going to time I have friends who know definitely was like you
know we love you matter but it felt alone for a lot of that time
so a lot of the reasons what we don't seek help is financial reasons and
because there is a stigma associated with mental health and that's kind of
the whole message with the campaign for this year for this week of Mental Health
Awareness Week is to eliminate the stigma of mental health
a lot of times you know I don't wanna make this video because i was like well
I want a job and I want course you see this
things like that but I remember going on youtube and watching all these videos
with people and people comments and everybody just comes together like I'm
showing with this - and seeing how you know people are also doing with this you
know that talk to in my job I had told me that they're done with this in your
not alone and there are people who are able to save issue are you shouldn't be
embarrassed to talk about fish that you're dealing with because it's really
important
recently my pastor seven lost his battle to depression and he was only when
you're older than me and we have done a communion together and I'm a hunger
we're in saying like kids sunday school
and I just when I found out I broke down and cried because I feel like that we
have a lot of similarities me kind of some major he also like music like I did
and I felt like that could have been me and I just felt so so much from a faster
because you know every time I had gone to church
I thought he was always speaking to be and that he was just a good man you
could just tell me
yeah
yeah
you know this time was very well the mission work is really involved a lot of
good causes
very intelligent and you just you never know
you still with the same issues that you are so when he would never have thought
in a million years
insulin with the same issues that you are is and that's what prompted me to
make this video was kept in a few weeks back
you know a lot of times people because he is but that really puts things in
perspective union
maybe you want to share my story because it seems some people stories like this
that it did help to feel like you're not alone if this can help one person like
they're not alone
you know you can always tell me you'll always have somebody who's in your
corner for you and who believes in you to seek out help
don't give up if it doesn't work out the first time you know sometimes will get
with the therapist and you may not match with them so well
keep trying don't give up this you know once you look back on that time with my
back it up . my life
because i can't believe that i was that low and it's not over
you know i think i'll always be doing with this
but just being honest about removing that Sigma that's the whole message for
this week is removing the stigma from they also mental illness
because so many people deal with it it's a very important issue to me which is
why now you know I'm start to volunteer with his organization in my towel that
provides mental health services musicians and so even if it's out there
going to your local community and being involved cost that you care about very
important thing to do so i hope this video helped at least one person and
that you have story one share in the comments feel free to do so if you have
any resources that you would like to share in the comments feel free to do so
i'll try to bring some as well that's all for now and thanks for watching
I don't know about you but I'm tired of watching this video

kidnapping and stalking and such a manner of these people for example you
