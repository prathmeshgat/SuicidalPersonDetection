hi everyone so I'm just going to do a quick video I don't have the time of the
corner of the day or anything but I've been like having like a week of
awesomeness and then we can feel like shape and for the past couple days I've
been feeling like total shit and I want to just let you that I haven't recovered
and that a lot of people think i have because i'm positively telling people
that I'm fine I'm okay and I'm good and that i'm in a good head space but
depression is still here i still have depression and it comes back to haunt me
everything now and it's always been there it's just that I , just triggers
me and some mornings I wake up and I don't even want to try some mornings I
wake up and I have existential crisis and I'm like what am I doing with my
life and what's going on and like why am I even trying and a lot of the times are
literally I wake up and I don't even want to you
I wake up and I feel like I shouldn't have it's a horrible feeling
and a lot of people can relate to me because there's a lot of times where she
gets hard when there's nothing specifically that triggers you when you
just wake up and it's sunny outside you feel like total shit
I haven't recovered I i have been dealing with self-harm
I can say that I've stopped self-harming as much as I'd like I did before I can
say that it's not something that happens too frequently but that's because
nothing has treated me as much as it has before and there are a lot of moments
where I feel strong and I'm like I feel like I myself but I do things to
distract myself
so when I feel like I'm depressed I I think this might work for a lot of you
guys to but because life when I feel depressed I feel like I'm losing control
and I'm a massive control freak I want everything to be controlled
so for example on monday i woke up feeling like Halle down and I was just
like I just didn't want to try felt like cutting myself and what I did for the
whole day
I just wrote this long list of things that I could do to make myself feel
better so for example i'm just going to get the list salary
sorry my camera fell down for example i just did this list this list that was
like things to do at home and would be like read Catcher in the Rye play
solitaire
I'm open direct messages doodle clean room paint my desk wash dishes have a
cigarette
I'm organized piles make mac updates
I'm just like a whole list of things over here that I can do and i would if i
put my phone as shuffle and I get a song say for example it's just called it's
called Andrea which is my favorite song as a and D are I a so that's six so i'd
go down to the sixth on the list and I do that and then I put after I do that I
do that for 12 minutes and put a timer on do it for 12 minutes and then because
I get bored very easily than I do like another one and then and then I'd like
to put another sovereign shuffle and whatever letters at that song has I go
down from that the sixth one into like whatever one and then I do that for 12
minutes and stuff like that because to me that's control to me that makes me
feel like I'm a hundred percent and control that the activity like you are
planned out and their time and their chosen by whatever randomness I choose
and that mean pretty much distracted me for the whole monday to not hurt myself
because I felt like I was in control
I woke up on tuesday and i didn't even have the drive to even start
boise or continue the legs are starting you on and I wouldn't say I felt
suicidal but I felt like what's the point what's the point of even trying
like what is the point
because people people die anyways and i didn't understand why I'm so doing this
and a lot of times when I feel depressed all i want to do is just call a friend
and a lot of the times are helping but I didn't even felt like I wanted to help
myself
that's the problem when you feel like you're really down and you don't want to
do anything about it because you're that down and i'm pretty sure a lot of people
can relate to this because that's why we're still depressed
I haven't recovered from all these things I i still have self harm it
because on Tuesday
I pretty much felt like on the whole monday i was distracting myself from
doing on tuesday i was like i have to do it after i did it i felt great i went
out to see friend and now I'm so much better because i felt like i was
bottling up and I was forcing myself so hard not to cut myself and i did and i'm
not saying that it was a good thing that I did because obviously it made me feel
like shit made me feel like total shit and if you want my you now I literally
just want there for a couple minutes and just cried the fact that i'm going to
Bali I'm gonna have scars on my arm and stuff like that and I felt like I needed
to make this video because so many of you guys I feel like you guys like
really lean on me because I'm kind of a bigger sister
I love that I love that you guys do that because it makes me try really hard to
stay strong
but then when i don't and i hurt myself or if i do something or if I if I
attempted suicide or something I put myself down too much because I'd like
all you guys down there is this weight on my shoulders that's good
good for me but it's also bad for me and part of me like really really hates it
but part of me loves it because it forces me to try to prove myself that
I'm ok because instead of just caring for myself
me being ok is going to care for the thousands of people huh who actually
care about me
I was just doing some research and everything what I learn something to me
because on pretty spiritual person
the reason why i'm stuck in depression is because I think of it as a bad thing
I think of it as a bad thing because depression is something that a lot of
people haven't had an investor employing their life a lot of people have had
depression or a lot of people have depression and one reason why I feel
like I'm not recovering from it is because I'm putting myself down for
having it and whatever i'm getting a sad state
I keep putting myself down I keep saying I'm not supposed to feel this way I'm
not this is not what I'm supposed to feel
I've been doing so well and stuff like that and a reality
it's okay and if I didn't worry so much because stress is like stress is such a
killer when you have depression and more you stress out you're like she had
depression are feeling depressed and that's when you stress out and that's
going to depression get even worse
and all you gotta do is be like you know what depression is like deep rest and
today I'm feeling depressed I need that deep breath i'm going to take a day off
take a day off lying in bed watch movies you know what do nothing if you have to
literally just take that deep rest forever how long you need
because the more you stress out
the more you try to force yourself out of it the more stress you get on
yourself which makes it so much worse
in fact about it is that we've got to stop treating it like it's such a such a
such a negative thing because it's something that's in us and we have to
just allow it to happen and soon as we accept it will go away because we won't
be stressing out so much about it and that's just how i see i don't know how
other people see it i think once i realized that i read read about that I
started to feel so much better because I was like you know what I can actually do
something about it
I'm sorry my hair so weird right now anyways this was a really quick video I
hope everyone's having a lovely day and I was what
let you guys know that I'm okay either way doesn't matter how down again
doesn't matter how deep I cut myself I'm always gonna be okay and so are you
