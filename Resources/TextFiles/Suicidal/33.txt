hey guys so today I'm going to talk about my suicide story and my foot was
cracked so I'm going to try to do this like in one take or very little editing
because i tend to edit a lot of my like zoning faces but anyway so here it goes
so it pretty much started on Sunday like that i took a ton of hills and i went to
bed because i got like sooo retired right away so i went to bed at like 6pm
I think and then on monday i remember on another reason why I wanted to make this
video so I don't forget the way I remember things so I remember going to
bed like with my bed like right up against this wall but like I have
another memory of me waking up and when my bed was like in that area in like my
bed was not in that area at the time so like that's weird memory that I created
in my mind but anyway so so pretty much i woke up at like 7am like getting ready
for school because my school started at nine sorry to wake up around that time
and I remember like being like oh my god I can't go to school like I'm not okay
like it's like one of those things where you're like halfway halfway asleep so I
went to my mom's room and I decided to like be like I can't go to school today
and like she was so mad at me but i just went back to bed and then like I woke up
with your like standing over me like being like you have to go to school and
stuff and then like that's the last thing I remember before i woke up at
like 7pm and was freaking out i can barely see anything I fella goes about
to pass out and I was like oh my god I'm gonna die like that
this isn't what I wanted like i thought i did like didn't so it was really hard
for me going on there
because like it's really hard to like tell your parents that i posted like
good-bye like a good night or goodbye but it's not something like I would
normally pose so yeah and I was like your ass down and stop and then I
remember on before I told my mom like what had happened i remember i was
texting him and I was like oh my god what do i do what do i do I think about
a die-in step and um he's like to go to the hospital or whatever he was he
wasn't saying it like a supportive way he was saying it like in like that
douchey tone he always has
I'm gonna um link this him out of respect by the way love you and I didn't
have a suicide note by the way for this and the last thing I wanted was to die
and have people think that I wanted to die
sorry I'm looking everywhere it's kind of late and I'm tired so mellow now you
know so i pretty much texting my mom and was like hey i overdosed on like this
drug and by the way I was kind of like tripping like it was crazy i was going
gravity shifts and stuff but anyway so I text my mom and I remember like in my
mind she came home like right away but she like told me that she came home like
an hour after i texted her that which is crazy but I also remember like making
pizza in the oven in the time that like she was coming to get me
like when i texted her and the time she got home so I remember like also eating
pizza in the car on the way to the hospital so we pretty much got in the
car and started going to the house and stuff and that's when things really went
down
like I was already feeling pretty shitty because I attempted suicide but so we
got to the emergency room and like we signed in but like there's this machine
that you like sign into so they don't like know right away what your issue is
and then like pretty much after like 10 minutes of us waiting in the emergency
room i like one out there and was like hey she needs to be back there so they
like took me back there and took me into a room and I don't know what they were
doing that room like I was like so like high at that point and then I remember
being in a bed in them like giving me a cup to go pee and and they did let me go
to like the bathroom on my own and pee in the cup i believe and i also remember
having to like stripped down to get an EKG and then I remember falling asleep
in the hospital room so the next day was pretty much horror for me so the drug i
took was on definitely not recommended for recreational use for sure but it on
like it's close your heart rate down really like it it's blood pressure
medication and I took a lot of it I remember telling the doctor that I only
took 11
that's because i wanted to make it seem like it wasn't such a big deal but I
took like a lot of it and I left to in the little late
pharmacy container that comes in just like my word this year or something that
she would think like oh she stopped taking and she's like to left so that
was just like my thought process of the time to lead to in there and so pretty
much on tuesday i had to go to the mental hospital
and something like this had what kind of already happened to me but I never
hospital i only went to a psych ward and I'll get into that in a different video
i guess the next day I don't remember what time it was but I was like having
horrible panic attacks that day because i was still like feeling the side
effects from what I took I could barely see like I cannot see the center but i
can see like peripheral vision so i wanted to look at something I have to
like focus there to look over there so that was pretty weird for me and my legs
were asleep the whole time like some people enjoy that feeling but like after
a while I absolutely hate being my legs being asleep so my legs were sleep and
like they um they would not stop falling asleep i remember sitting in like the
rim of the mental hospital after they took me in like an ambulance to get
there like just screaming at my mom was so angry with me like I guess she wasn't
angry but she like didn't know what to do with me at that point and like I knew
I had to calm down also would put me like crazy people area but eventually I
went to the adolescents area and I met two people there that i already kind of
knew from my school which is weird because this place was on in like a
different city you've been mostly i live in into people from my school like that
lived in the same area as me like word there in the mental hospital
so pretty much shot with the mental hospital and I was feeling really weird
because I felt like I didn't belong there but i guess like everyone felt
that because that's kind of like how it goes
my roommate was a call from my old school the school that was talking about
and
like I know another girls that you select pick on me and stuff so I really
did not like her and then once she like left like I think like three days later
like I found out that she was talking like so much shit about we stop like all
mental hospital like it wasn't horrible
it wasn't too bad but like then it was hell because right when I got there one
of those like nurses stripped me all the way naked and then like when I asked
like the other girls i guess i got stripped like all the way they were like
no we only got to our underwear so like that I kind of felt violated their but I
guess that's their job right so um and my blood pressure was incredibly low
level like still like I don't think they should have took me outlaws like at the
time it was alright but now that i think about it like I definitely should have
actually been in the hospital play in not a mental hospital where they can't
help you at all and by the way I didn't get any help with the little like they
really like just watch you like the only reason i think it would help is like if
you're in a and incredibly abusive situation where like they can protect
you from the outside world
Oh moron to like um actually being in the hospital like it was such a blur for
me because I was like hi and stuff on I forgot what it was called but it's like
some anxiety medication that like also lowers your blood pressure but anyway so
I was so out of it and like actually remember on like my sister gave me like
her stuffed animal like sheep to take with me so I took it with me and let me
even took it with me to the mental hospital but they took it away from me
and I never got it back and they also never gave me back a whole set of my
clothes and a suitcase of mine so that's also a downside of being through the
hospital
these are memories like I remember the night I overdose
so like so many different ways like first I remember like getting in an
argument with my friend the lake
I don't think that happened that night like it's such a blur like what happened
because I was experiencing like so many different things at once and also like
one of like the hallucinations I had well-being on that drug like a guy came
down and salad beside my bed and he was like everything's gonna be alright and
I'm like that was really weird for me but I was kind of like I'm loosening
like one of those like hallucinations where you know you're hallucinating
the only like good part about being in the mental hospital was like they
sometimes let you listen to the radio it smelled horrible in there in the first
day I smelled horribly bad because they didn't give me any soap or deodorant or
anything but then like someone told me that like I could just like gonna be
like a can you give me something
oh yeah we have almonds and like we have like stoner text in there to talk about
like they're like oh yeah it's like a huge fine support life
it was pretty weird but like I guess we have a lot of good times almost new
people only himself contact with one of them and i'm going to send them this
video actually hi feel like I keep feel like I'm forgetting so many things
that's why it's so hard for me almost like also putting it up on the Internet
is a huge Reds but i'm going to take it can like you're somewhat different
direction
