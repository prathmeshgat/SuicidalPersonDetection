hey guys arm today I'm going to make a serious video
I know that I haven't been making them and a long time but I miss having them
on my channel and I know that they do help people so I wanted to make this one
arm
I've been really open about this as you can see from the title of this video
what this is about
are so then pretty open about it and I've had so much support from you guys
and I thought that if I could just come back and I don't know talk about it and
maybe help anyone that may be feeling this way then it's worth it even if it
just helps one person
so today I'm going to talk about my
suicide attempt and I really talked about this
like in this way i guess about a month ago I tried to kill myself
I know that it's not something you should be open about you should just
kind of be quiet about it but I got something opposite and it's not an
attention thing because I feel like when you're feeling that well and that
depressed that you do need help
and you'll get it from anywhere that you can even if it's just support from other
people and I think we all deal with things in different ways
some people are really closed up about being sad and some people are really
open about it
I mean even some of the happiest people can be really surprised but sometimes
you can notice when people are it's just that everyone everyone handles in
different ways and the way i do is by being open about it and talking about it
because I feel better by doing it that way
so a month ago I tried to take my own
I i took a ton of pills and i'm still here when I was in a hospital had a
drink charcoal which is not a fun thing to drink and our i also had to deal with
I had to see the people that I love and I care about and how they reacted to
what I tried to do to myself and seeing that was one of the most painful things
just because I I never really realized that by trying to take myself I was
taking other people with me and I don't think people see that when they're
depressed because when you're depressed you are can't help but only feel
yourself you can only feel the negative things inside yourself the pain and you
can't feel anything positive you can't feel that other people are caring about
you
that anyone wants to talk to you want to make it better and after doing that I I
saw it I saw that people do care and people do want to help and and though
stick with you through the entire thing no matter how hard it is
so I just want to kind of talk about sadness and anyone that's fighting this
right now and i will get better
I know that it's so hard to see that all you see right now is just like almost
like you're in some kind of dream that you can't see anything else besides
everything bad that's happening in your life whether it be like a job situation
of friendship relationship even your family any kind of problem if it's your
health
I mean we all struggle if it's bullying and we all have to battle something and
sometimes a battle gets really hard and it gets really hard to the point where
you don't want to fight it anymore but i just want to tell you that you have to
keep fighting no matter how hard it is no matter if waking up is like the most
painful thing in the world to do you have to do it
the last thing you want is to not be here anymore
you don't want that because in a couple years from now
everything might be okay again it will be ok
again things change so much in a year and change constantly happens which
means that a lot of times things can be really bad with change it also means
that it'll get going to gun you just have to know just have to fight it out
and even if your demons are really really strong and they want to take you
down
you have to show them that you won't let them
I think it's if you want to get rid of yourself if you just don't want to be
here anymore
you fight just to show the world that that you will be here and you don't quit
fighting until the world has bought your impact interest don't stop
and
you might come out with a couple scars you might
end up fighting something that you never thought you'd have to fight
what you need to just realize is that through all of the darkness that there's
a white somewhere
depression is like an open wound and just like any open wound
you have to give it time to heal and if you leave it open if you make it worse
if you tear it open or you want to get infected or you leave it and you don't
tend to it you'll die but if you wait and you want to get better and you give
it time
then I don't heal and you'll still have the scar we all have scars and how
powerful of a story when you have a scar that says that you survived also really
good stuff that you can do like taking walks because you can see that the world
is still so full of beauty and that you have to be here to see it evolve and get
better and going on like long drives and listening to music or things like that
something that can make you feel alive something that will make you feel again
something positive that
make you feel again even if it's at night you can go outside just lay on the
grass just watch the stars just cry you can cry it's okay to cry it's okay to
feel because you have to its life and if that's what you need to do to get
through this and to let it pass and to get better than do it
there is a woman that i watch on YouTube a lot that our house me a lot with my
depression and her name is Andrea Gibson

I mean sometimes I get a lot of messages so i might not be able to respond to all
of them but you still just try and even if it's just venting if you want to get
it out you can just say whatever it is that they say what you need to say just
to get it out there just so that you feel a little butter
so you know you're not carrying as much but just stay okay just keep fighting
because
it's going to get better
I love you guys
