hello my name is Tanner O'Brien and this makes me so sad for it all comes
together trust last year in which he near schools are sure to look up all is
coming up here then search for some reason this idea came to me I never
thought that sort of idea to me one day in February when he was gay and he gave
me some really good advice on it and I sort of came out to one of my good
friends and they'll really weird to say but for some reason I just said on this
time so we talked for about an hour then I would know that have to that kind of
the gate in the back of my head
and try not to think about it again a month later I depression was grown in
Poland Spring Break contemplate my choice I wanted to go to the hospital
say what they would do it
inserted heart went to the same pain during a senior in high school
be sad for getting involved time I think about the next chapter in my life and I
need me to reinforce my life and I going to be seen
friends and stuff like the week after she was talking to my good friend and
that's been going on inside my head
then getting these mass suicidal thoughts about taking he told me that I
need to go see this course there is so I listened to the week after spring break
it was a wednesday was the morning I went into his go there and I told her
I'm thinking about killing myself we talked for about 30 minutes and I told
her what's going on in their plans on how to kill myself from there the school
call came in and I sent to the community hospital was put on 5150 5160 creditors
and others are basically put on hold I can be a 2400 hold or longer and
California Community Hospital for
then they're not make any just here to my Dark Stranger for me to 120 this year
the service for about a month and a half and also going to see the school
therapist for all things but not that much during the months of April and May
15
harming myself constantly about two to three times a week I was having mental
breakdowns whenever
focus on school and also almost gradually also getting lost in the US
each day and evening starting lose weight rock and they try to every day
and it was hell for me was made 28 was made 26 was going in my life was washing
my mom and I love you kids from a nearby committed to it just made me feel like
nothing is going to start I just had to end they do that they're gonna pictures
of depression stuff because I was going to post one and they say it's a known
face I said my good friend from the beginning a text saying I need help he
told me that I need to go to the hospital again the next day when my
teacher sent me back to school there is she's noticed a massive change their
behaviour at school I went to see the school with their cousins told me that
the paramedics are on their way to show her my journal with all my thoughts and
the voices heard
ever tell me myself and just in my life one of the parent wants the paramedics
sentiments all adult one not child I was really shaken once I got there it was a
totally different experience I didn't expect myself to like it
change my mind a lot and I appreciate in my life a lot more a dark and depressing
interested call it once I was released I was back home and in the end of my girl
scouts your money that day and I graduated high school because I went to
an affair she told me she's a lot better in the summer of 2015 was the worst so
am I still getting depressed and now it's getting a lot of weight has been
met and August are shorter questioned myself I started washing coming out
again then I told a close friend and he's gay he has helped me figure it out
and basically figure out my hair after that have caused it I guess it and I
don't want to think about it and it was the middle semester cause my therapist
nice I need to go to get up again and hopefully they can change my meds
because they weren't working so much
that would be the decision because when I was about to jump off a building
should have talked to my talk about this so we didn't we just want we're just
what I was talking about that day and she was fine with it a second time
extreme so many terms and conditions of the different patients I saw there and
plus this girl was hitting on someone say I wasn't like I was getting through
the weeks I did and I didn't hurt myself and just got their first semester calls
with Google Earth after being admitted to a psych ward in November I came to
the conclusion that I'm charging two guys and I like I told my therapist and
she was happy for me and I came to the conclusion that the major parts major
questions me sexually just having to steal and resentment of not truly be
myself my everyday life my depression is also and plus a lot of other things in
my life but through these times even my darkest time I thought about the people
that her if I did in my life that kept me going throughout life does get better
and it's not worth it trust me I've been through two aspirations and I had
depression for over a year and I still fighting every day
and about all they're taking thank you for watching this year
