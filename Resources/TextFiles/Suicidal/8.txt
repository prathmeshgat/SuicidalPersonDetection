today I thought I would talk about a subject that 
is really close to home 
pound for me at least and I'm pretty sure it is for a majority 
of the population but 
maybe talking about my suicide story in my various attempts 
so if that kind of thing triggers you 
please do not watch this video that's the last thing you want to do is trigger anybody 
so anyways %HESITATION 
we'll get right into it 
I'm 
I first started feeling suicidal 
probably 
January twenty twelve 
so about a year and a half ago 
%HESITATION 
I was thirteen at the time almost fourteen 
and my depression was really bad 
as I put my life on 
I really do not care about anything 
I don't even care about running and you guys know running is like one of the most important things in the world to me 
but I just started to kind of give up I questioned for a long time 
kind of like what is the point of life and 
why 
why am I even living like 
my mind is already a hell 
why should I not in hell right now like I was kind of my thinking process 
as illogical 
as it sounds that's what I was thinking at the time 
so it got worse and worse %HESITATION 
it was January twenty seven 
I 
took about 
twenties Olaf's 
and fifteens Arguello pills 
and I should die probably within five or ten minutes 
but I 
my mom walked in on me here 
she held her child half dead 
and I have to live with that guilt for the rest of my life 
so there are two major hospital 
a poem to my stomach all that jazz 
earn 
I thought I was gonna live for awhile 
but they got it made it through 
I would impatient I was my second time there 
here 
not dying really dragged down my self esteem to 
it was like 
I can't do anything right I cannot even kill myself correctly like 
that's what I was thinking and it just made it worse and worse 
inpatient actor thing it just made my life worse so in March 
%HESITATION 
I was sent back there again for 
being severely underweight com 
my heart good to stop anytime 
my most recent suicide attempt was 
January of this year 
here I slit my wrists 
from here to my elbow 
and all them 
and I was bleeding out 
my best friend found me 
she found me laying there in a pool of my own blood
