hi guys it's a dress so first of all just ignore my bed in the background and
no it's not made but i just wanted to share this story
I'm warning you it's not for everybody not everybody is gonna want to hear this
you know if you're in a super good mood you know if you're having a really good
day
you might not want to watch don't want to be the one to crash your mood it's
gonna be me telling you a story about a very big event that happened a year ago
this week in my life
it's sad it's kind of graphic and it has to do with self-harm and if you're not
interested in watching I seriously will not be offended if you know you're just
like all I can't watch
that's fine with me but I debated with myself whether or not i was going to
post this
I thought about it for a couple weeks as the date was getting closer to it being
a year and I'm like do I really want to put all this out there and I was like
you know if I had seen somebody make a video like this
back when I was suffering the way I was maybe it would have had some sort of
impact on me so i feel like i do want to put this out there if it could help just
one person my story and me explaining what really happens you know if it could
benefit one person it would all be worth it to me you know going through all of
it
I've always said that if my story could help somebody or change their life or be
of encouragement to them
I would do it all over again we will take it back to october two thousand
twelve i had gone to my doctor about my prescriptions
I'm still on antidepressants and everything and that's a complete
different story but i have to go look every three months for like a routine
check up because like when you're on antidepressants they have you come back
so I gone back to my doctor and we were talking and she was just like you know
if you're still feeling so depressed
you should probably be going to counseling and you know talk some things
out and I agreed with her I was like you know yeah
it probably would be of some benefit to me so I started going to counseling in
the summer of last year and it was continuing on into October October 17th
of 2012
I decided you know to invite my mom to go with me because my counselor been
like you know you can invite your family if you want so I invited my mom and her
and I went and well around that time actually was a few days prior to this a
girl that I had known for a little while had committed suicide I wasn't very
close to her but we had talked a few times and she was a friend of mine you
know she had helped me through some things and she had committed suicide
just a couple days before my mom had brought that up to the counselor that a
friend of mine had committed suicide and the counselor asked my mom are you
afraid that
adria might do the same thing and then I looked at my mom and she looked at me
and she just broke down in tears crying just this huge weight of guilt kind of
came over me like wow I I couldn't believe that I had my mom feel this way
you know I couldn't believe that she would think that I would you know take
my own life which having depression and horrible anxiety obviously it
it came over me a couple times you know like I did at one point have severe
suicidal thoughts but I never wanted to act on them at all like I was I was too
afraid I was too afraid to even try
so the house or send my mom do you think she needs to go to an inpatient
hospitalization program
my mom just looked at me and she was like yeah I I i do and my mom just
express how afraid she was losing me especially with the couple days before
that girl committed suicide I think it just kind of brought some reality to the
whole depression thing and where it actually can end things you know it can
it can take somebody's life so my mom was just she just wanted me to feel
better then my counselor asked me she was like would you be willing to go to
an inpatient hospital and I just
and they both were looking at me and waiting for an answer and I kind of just
SAT there and I looked down at my hands you know like just lost in thought just
kind of like it was probably only about like 10 seconds of me thinking to myself
I couldn't see a way around it
I got myself into this and you know I don't think I don't think I know how to
get myself out so I was like yeah I'll go
then the counselor was like I suggest you just go right to the hospital you
know don't go home first don't go home and pack because when people do that
they tend to change their minds or it makes them super anxious and they end up
not going but then we got out of the car and i said to my mom I was like can I
just stopped by the house and get my phone charger and she was like yeah mom
had called my grandma by then and my Grandmama's on the driveway and she just
hugged me and was crying and all that and so I got my phone charger and then
we were on our way
gosh it it felt like the longest car ride of my life like we were only in the
car for maybe like an hour but it felt like an eternity
the whole time in the car I was just thinking myself you know how could I
have gotten myself to this point how could I let this happen how could I do
this to myself
I felt so guilty that I had done this to my poor mother who had done nothing but
try to love me all these years and I I just felt like the worst human being in
the world
I didn't know what else to do so I was like you know I just I have to do this
for myself I knew I was doing the right thing
so then we got there and I signed it and everything and fill out all these papers
and all that stuff and we are sitting in a waiting room and as we were sitting
there
my anxiety just got so horrible
I was just thinking about all the possibilities of what could possibly
happen while I was there and I was like oh my word this is this is horrible
I didn't know what was gonna happen I didn't know what to expect and having
anxiety that is like the last thing you want you want to know what to expect you
want to know what's gonna happen and just that whole unknown thing
it was really starting to hit me
you know like I had no control over what was happening yeah there were other
people in the room and it was super quiet so my mom didn't want to like talk
out loud to me so she texts me like are you okay
even though she's sitting right next to me and I was like no can we leave
so then my mom just whispers to me do you think you belong here and I was like
no I don't like I don't think I belong here
we got up to leave we got out of the waiting room and we are in a hallway and
we went to walk through these doors and the doors were locked and then that's
when it kind of hit me the light oh my gosh like I'm i'm stuck here
i I can't leave if I don't even know who that this guy was but he took us back
into this room and at this point I was angry
like I'm one of those people that when i'm super anxious and I am stuck in a
situation i get really angry like if I can't leave a place where I just don't
feel comfortable it makes me mad
I wasn't talking i was super upset i just wanted to go home
and this doctor he like presented all these papers that I had to sign and
everything and my mom was like can you explain to her what happens if she
doesn't sign these papers and he was like well you know and my mom completely
like flipped out on this guy she was like you know if you're not going to
explain to her what's going to happen if she doesn't sign these papers and i'm
going to like she just completely throw it down his face like and then he was
just like my mom said you know like if you don't sign these
then things could get completely worse and then you might not get out of here
as quickly as you would like to just sign them and just be done with it so I
signed them and the doctor left and my mom and I were just sitting in this room
all alone and she's like a jury you just have to be strong and get through this
you know it's it's kind of a blur to me everything that was said in that moment
because i was crying and I was kind of I was curled up in my seat and with my
face like tucked under like that and I was so scared I was
I was more scared than anything and I didn't know what I was going to leave
and I didn't know you know I didn't know what was gonna happen so I was just I
was terrified and my mom just hugged me and she was like listen the more you
make them think you belong here
the longer will keep you in here and she was like the best thing you can do is to
just be strong and then things will be a lot easier
it clicked in my head I was like you know what she's right like if I act like
this
anxious wreck then they're never gonna let me leave
I knew in my head what I had to do at that point
this is the one really vivid thing I remember from being alone in that room
with my mom she was like is there any message you want me to deliver to your
sisters and to my stepdad and everybody and so I took a piece of paper and I
wrote on a my favorite quote ever its everybody wants happiness nobody wants
pain we can't have a rainbow without a little rain and my mom just started
bawling her eyes out and she was like
the flu so this guy came to take me to the unit that i was going to be staying
on
so my mom was walking with me and we were outside and it was dark
my mom couldn't go in with me because the visiting hours were over for that
day
and so we hugged outside and i gave my mom my phone
all i had was my purse that was that was all i had was my purse so I walked in
with him and I was crying so I just hugged my mom goodbye and I didn't know
when I was gonna get to see her again so he was like just wait here and i just
sat in the chair and I was crying and it was just so intimidating
so this is the part that was probably the most traumatizing
so then the lady that was sitting behind this desk and a female nurse they took
me into this room where they basically had to inspect me and the nurse said I
mean she was like you have anything sharp the only drugs or whatever and I
was like no I think I just shook my head so I was crying and they they had to Pat
me down and everything and they were just like feeling to see if I had
anything under my clothes I think that's when I realized the type of place I was
really and I was like wow they like deal with people that would like have things
under their clothes and I was like well so then they said you know we have to
take all your clothes off and everything I was like oh my goodness i was actually
wearing the same party and I wore this on purpose so I could show you they took
this thing out of it
they took my bell and they took my shoelaces
they took anything that was sharp that could be used as like a weapon or
something and then they were like yeah we're going to take all your clothes off
so i took all of my clothes off besides my underwear and this is probably the
lowest I've ever felt in my entire life and I don't know if anybody can relate
to this it was just it felt like they basically it's stripped me of all that I
had and I just felt like I had nothing
I don't really know how to put it into words I just basically felt like I just
I had I had nothing left
I i was just empty and I was broken
and so then what they did was they had this like a body chart thing on like a
clipboard and whatever and it was a diagram of like a body and they put
where all my cuts were and I guess just so they could like keep track
if like anything else appeared on me I guess all that I had at the time was it
was this arm and it was just from like here to like here
it was just like completely I'm just cut up and then just inspecting it and
looking at it in like pointing it out and me standing there with like out any
clothes on and it was just I was just sobbing I was like I feel like I'm
tearing up right now
I just I couldn't believe that I had let myself get to that point with the whole
self harm thing I was like you know I have control over a I can stop by will
stop this is my last time doing it and the fact that I'd let myself get there
it was just a wake-up call and and standing there in front of two strangers
in my underwear and then inspecting my body and my cuts and everything it was
just it was it was probably the worst I've ever felt in my entire life and I
then that night I didn't have any pajamas or anything so they gave me a
hospital gown and everything and it didn't even like tire anything it was
like the most annoying thing ever
I had a roommate who was like pretty much as old as my mom and I just I
didn't even say anything the roommate I didn't even acknowledge her i just went
to my bed
I just laid there wide awake and I was like just staring at the wall just
crying and I was talking to God and I was like God just take me just take me
just take me just take me and it sounds really disturbing now that i think about
it
so if you can even imagine yourself feeling that way like talking to God and
just saying just take me home
just take me to heaven I just want to be in heaven and after a couple minutes of
thinking that to myself that I was remembering back to what my mom and said
you know that I have to be strong
the more they think I belong there the longer they keep me here so I remember
thinking that
I was like you know I can't be this victim i can't be this defeatist
I couldn't let them be right about what they thought about me because obviously
by looking at me see me crying and you know have cuts all over my arm they
probably thought I was just this mess so I didn't want them to see me like that
and I was like you know I i have to prove everybody wrong
I knew I had to prove everybody in that place wrong then I said a prayer to God
before I went to sleep I was like the choices I've cry huh
so I said God either either take me to heaven or give me the strength I need to
make out of here
and with that i fell sound asleep then they woke me up at like six o'clock and
they have to do like vital signs and whatever and like they checked all that
and everything but yeah then the next morning I woke up and I I felt like at
peace after I'd said my prayer I was like I was like you know i'll just i'll
try to make the best of this so I got through the day and I had called my mom
and I talked to her and since i was in this hospital gown like my arm that was
cut was completely exposed and I just walked around like it wasn't even there
you know I wanted to radiate something that I knew that I was and that this
place was not reflecting who I was inside this was so hard for me because
me being a person with severe separation anxiety like this was just all I know
growing up with separation anxiety
being away from home being away from my mom it was just
oh if you have problems with self-harm or problems with anxiety and depression
like that's that's really the end result like if you get to that low point where
we can't go any lower besides death
you know that is where you will go I wouldn't wish that place on my worst
enemy I really really would it was it was horrible
you know but I i held my head up high and I wanted to be strong I I was strong
and I remember
probably something that remains so clear in my mind was I was sitting at this
table like drawing and stuff like that and I
got a marker on my hand i wrote i can do all things through Christ who
strengthens me and I remember one of the counselors saw and he said to me was
like good for you
I was like yeah I don't know I just I felt really proud of myself
I got there on a Wednesday and they let me out Friday morning so i was really
only there one full day and then I remember the friday when i was leaving I
was in like the last counseling session and the counselor said to me she's like
well adrian is leaving us today and and she was like you know do you have
anything to say to the group before you leave
and I was like yeah there was maybe like 10 people that were in the entire unit
you know it wasn't too many people so i looked at everybody in the room and I
said well I heard once that once a wound is healed that the scar there is
stronger than the skin that was there originally and I said so whether your
wounds are physical or mental once they're healed
you'll be stronger than you were before you know I always said you know once I
left there I said in my mom you know if I could share this with somebody and it
and it would save their life you know that would be worth it to me
you know me going through this if it could help just one other person it
would mean everything to me and it would make it all worth it because I love it
when something I say touches somebody else or inspires them or or gives them
hope you know and I don't talk about self-harm or anything like that for
attention or sympathy
like I don't want that I don't want attention i don't want sympathy
I just remember myself back then in if i had heard if i had heard just an ounce
of hope and it would have meant a lot to me you know it's a very serious thing
and I think a lot of people are just afraid to talk about it because it's it
can be embarrassing and it can be overwhelming and you don't want to
believe that you could end up in a hospital but i didn't think i could
either and it happened
I'm proud of myself I'm proud of myself
for overcoming that and self-harm is such a hard thing like even after
getting out of the hospital i know i didn't completely stopped you know it's
completely is like a drug
you know you just become so dependent on it and I just believe that God is going
to use me to inspire other people that go through it in and you know I really
do think that this is why i believe in god because I I don't know where I would
be without God like that prayer i said my first night you know either take me
to heaven or give me the strength they need to get out of here
and after that my life was changed
I felt like a different person and I just had this strength that I never knew
I had
you know god is good even in times like that even in times where we're at our
lowest you know god is god is good and there's so much more to life than just
surviving
and that's all I was doing at the time was just surviving
and now I just I feel like I'm starting to live in
I'm just I'm so thankful that I got all the help and support i needed at the
time and I was able to go out of it and sometimes it's just best to just
acknowledge that you need help because i'm always that person that's like I
just want to do this myself I want to do this myself but we can always do it
ourselves
so that's my story and I'm sorry I'm crying
you know it's emotional for me because it was a was a big event in my life and
it did change me it changed how it looks and everything and I just I treasure my
life now
i thank god for giving me a second chance because I don't know if I would
be here today if I had gone that day
everybody out there that you know struggles with anything no matter what
it is it doesn't have to be self harm if you struggle with anything
everybody wants happiness nobody wants pain being can never rainbow that little
green
so I love you guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video
