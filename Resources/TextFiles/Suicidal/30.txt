hey guys up its Raven and i'm coming to you fully natural no makeup hair is a
mess just got out of the shower so please excuse that hopefully it's not
too distracting and also hopefully my filming set up is not too distracting i
am currently filming out on my parents back porch and there's lots of
construction going on and there's lots of people walking in wind blowing but
there's no real secluded area inside the house for me to film and I'm just kind
of out of my element today so I didn't really have much of a choice for my
filming set up and this video is not about being cute or being perfectly set
up it's more about just me having some real talk with you guys so I hope that
it still works and if i seemed really uncomfortable and like just weird in
this video it's because I am uncomfortable I'm like filming like to
the world right now like I think the whole neighborhood and it's just really
weird but we're just gonna go with it
so this video is kind of addressing two things will kind of there's two reasons
why I wanted to make this video the first thing is that I kind of felt the
need to explain my recent absence explain the reason why I've taken this
break from youtube and why I haven't been posting videos why I seem set on
social media
what's been going on with you what's been happening i've been getting so many
comments and messages like where are you what are you doing what's wrong are you
okay blah blah blah
there's just been all this speculation and questions and concern about where
I've been lately because i've just been kind of taking us that bad kind of
taking a break kind of maybe seeing a little bit upset like that so I kind of
wanted to come on here and maybe explain that a little bit but also i wanted to
come on here and just have like a real talk and get personal and just make a
meaningful video not only just to explain myself but also because like
this is a topic that i think is important and it's a topic that I care
about and it's a topic that I haven't really fully touched on on my channel
that I feel like it's worth talking about so I kind of wanted to make its
own separate video all about it
I don't even know it's hard for me to make this video because it's like
so many different things that I could say and I don't even know where to start
or what to say or how to say it but basically i have been well i'm here at
my parents house and i have been here at my parents house for like several weeks
now like probably almost a month not quite a month I've been here for like
three weeks or something like that and that's part of the reason why i have not
been posting videos and have not been doing my whole regular routine is
because I've been here at my parents house and if you guys have been keeping
up with my weekly blogs you know that I just moved into my own you know nice
apartment in Dallas so it's like why are you here in Austin your parents house
and it's basically because I'm kind of on a little you could call it kind of
like a rehab a retreat a getaway whatever you want to call it i needed to
come here to my parents house to basically sorry I needed to come here to
my parents house to basically get away from my life
get away from what was happening in my own little circle at my apartment in
Dallas stuff like that and I needed the support of my parents so I came here and
now you're probably wondering like well what happened what happened why did you
need support what went wrong and basically and i just want to give you
guys a little bit of a background story some of you guys who have been following
me for years and years and years the ones who have been here since my tumblr
day since I was like 14 in high school you guys have been here that long
you may already know that i have struggled with anxiety and depression
and different issues like that for a long time if you've been here if you've
been following me that long you might already know that but a lot of you guys
who have maybe more recently started following me or just don't really like
to guys that in that close in to my channel you may not know that about me
but yes i have struggled with anxiety and depression as far as I'm concerned
all my life and when I say anxiety and depression
I don't just mean oh well sometimes I feel sad sometimes I feel nervous you
know whatever whatever it's not like that it's actually more of a bigger deal
i guess it's more of something that actually affects my day-to-day life it
actually affects the way that you feel like all the time and it's it's
something that only gets worse over time if you don't deal with it and I did not
do a very good job of dealing with in the beginning I didn't do a very good
job of asking for help I didn't do a very good job of seeking help of taking
in the help i didn't do but yeah I didn't I'd makes me when I was trying to
say is i just didn't do a very good i haven't been doing a very good job of
dealing with it up until now
you bet you I cannot do this and you may be surprised to know that even though
i'm saying i didn't do a very good job of dealing with it or whatever
actually I did do stuff about i have been to therapists counselors I've been
to multiple therapists and counselors I've even been to the counselor that was
on my college campus when I was in college family counselor data I've done
things I've I recognize okay i have depression I have anxiety i need help i
need something about it i need to go to a counselor I've done little things like
that but never really liked Joe that deep into it never really took it
seriously and never really got a grip on it and like I said with something like
this it gets worse and worse over time when you let it have that snowball
effect so all throughout my teenage years I definitely struggled a lot with
depression anxiety i think its a mix of being a teenager you're growing there's
things changing your life you have hormones you have your typical teenage
problems but having your typical teenage problems and then on top of that
struggling with depression and anxiety can be really really dangerous and
really really bad and I had some really really low points as a teenager I mean
if you guys follow my blog there was times when I was just writing these
really terrible things that were happening and how I was feeling so
terrible
blah blah blah and it was a lot of to what looks like teenage angst and oh
she's being bratty oh she's just being
you know hormonal but really it was my depression like I actually had
depression and then you know I thought things might get better throughout
college but college is not just a magical cure it's not just alcohol is so
great college is great in a way but there's lots of ecology comes with its
own problems that comes with some bigger problems and stuff like that so I
definitely dealt a lot with my depression in college as well i made a
video like last area it was either earlier this year or last year when i
made a video called how I became happy which was kind of my way of touching on
the fact that I have been struggling with depression and struggling with
certain things in my life but that I in that moment I felt really happy and I
felt like I really overcame something and the reason why I felt that way is
because i had gotten out of a really really toxic relationship once again you
guys have been following me you might know that i was in a previous
relationship
it wasn't good it was always drama and blah blah blah i had introduced him to
you guys thinking everything was great everything was not great
it really took a toll on me like i said just being a regular girl and just being
a young college girl if you're in a bad relationship that's Maddie up but like I
said he believes is having that with all of that is what makes it worse so that's
what I was dealing with in that relationship and finally got out of that
relationship and I felt so free and I felt so happy and I felt so successful
because my youtube channel is picking up so many good things were happening that
I made that being called how I became happy and I was such a good everything's
great and I just thought my life was just gonna be amazing for their on album
my life is very amazing.its so many amazing things have happened to me
especially this year 2015 is definitely like my glow up here so many amazing
things happen to me this year like so many I can't even begin to explain like
the success of my youtube channel the trips that I've been able to go on the
brands I've been able to work with the people that I've met opportunities that
I've had
I do have a very amazing life so to speak but i am still depressed and the
thing with depression is that depression to the way I'm a lot of people can
described as a disease just like some people have allergies
some people have the right people you have cancer some people have people
there are in their blood pressure
some people have depression it's not something that you choose to have is not
something that you do on purpose is not something that is because of this or
because of that is actually something that comes from within your body it
comes from within the chemicals in your brain is something that you can't
control because the chemicals in your brain have an imbalance loss of the time
so it is actually a medical cause behind it that pretty much innocent
no matter what's going on in your life you can have an amazing life you can be
going on trips and this and that but at the same time the chemicals in your
brain are still causing you problems and you can still be depressed even when you
have all this fun stuff happening in your life and that describes me really
well because I know a lot of people look at me and look at my life and all things
I'm doing all things that i have in their life
you're so lucky you have such an amazing life how could you possibly be the press
what do you mean depression what do you mean anxiety what do you mean
blah blah blah and they can really be judgmental about it or confused about it
but it's it's just not like that i don't have that choice it's not it's not
related like I said it's an actual mental disorder is an actual disease
it's actually based on health reasons it's actually based on chemicals in your
brain that I can't really control that no matter what's happening in my life
that's the best way I can explain it i mean i know some people they can just be
really hard to believe that I struggle with depression all my life with the
type of life that I've had but it's true it's true I don't know how to really
explain it
um so yeah after I have made that how i became happy video I really thought that
my life which is so awesome and it's never gonna get bad again but it was
kind of like I only really attacked one problem in my life and I didn't actually
attack my depression itself
okay yeah i got out of this bad
relationship but i'm still I still have depression you know I'm still dealing
with the deep-rooted main issue is still there so I'm thinking everything is cool
when really it's not again kind of ever since then I it's kind of like creeped
back up it's like we here comes my depression coming back he thought
everything was cool but really it's not in here i am again and it's just kind of
been creepin creepin creepin all the way through
you know I have my college graduation this year big changes big changes happen
this year graduating college getting my own apartment becoming a full-time
youtuber blase blase blase getting in a new relationship allows the gloves they
all this stuff is happening and one thing about me and my depression is that
is very based on stress I've noticed that i can keep it cool i can kind of
feel normal feel okay as long as I'm in a pretty stress-free environment as long
as I feel in control as long as I feel like there's not too much going on
around me I can you know keep it pretty cool keep everything under wraps you
know by myself in my own control but when things start to get stressful when
things start to pile up when things start to just I feel like I'm losing
control or I thought it was too much happening at once and this is scary and
this is scary
that's when my depression just boom like comes out and it's like crippling and
it's like I can't function with all these changes that have been happening
recently in my life like this these past few months or so with you know
graduating college and moving and all just all this stuff like I feel like my
life just kind of exploded these past few months it was a high high high
stress environment and it caused my depression to spike like crazy and I
wasn't prepared for it and I kind of feel like it came out of nowhere and it
just not to me out it knocked me down so so hard and I'm not the type of person
who has ever just had like a million friends and just huge circle of friends
to distract me and support me and especially now that I'm moved away I
really don't have my friends around me that much
and
is not to say that it's like my friends ball I definitely wanted to put that out
there that my friends are not bad people my friends are not doing anything wrong
i'm not blaming my friends or anything i don't want any of my friends to watch
this video and be like I'm not my god I feel so
oh my god i need to say something to you blah blah blah because throughout this
whole time that I've been taking this break-in kind of on this hiatus and kind
of saying that there is something wrong but not really explaining what's wrong
my friends have definitely reached out to me like people texted me people send
me messages on snapchat however they could they were texting what's wrong
what's going on
senior social media I've seen that you said you were taking a personal break
what can I do what's going on and so it's not their fault it's just that
they're in other cities there in other states they're not here and I myself
don't feel comfortable talking to that I didn't feel comfortable talking to my
friends at all like i'm making this video right now really before I even
talk to my friends about it because i'm not i'm a person who is very embarrassed
about my depression I'm very embarrassed when I get in these states where my I
feel like my body's like shutting down my mind shutting down i'm in such a deep
depression i'm embarrassed about it I'm embarrassed that I feel that way I'm
embarrassed that i'm at my parents house and I have to take this break and I'm
not being productive and I'm not going to the events and I can't hang out and I
can't do this and I can't do that because I'm in such a low state that's
embarrassing to me so when my friends reach out to me and they're asking me
what's wrong talk to me that the dog I just don't reply i'm just like nothing I
don't know what to say or I just don't reply because I just I don't even want
to talk about and I know that's really sad
please but that's why I'm saying like it's not their fault but it's just it
aight it's a vicious cycle because then i end up not having that support because
I'm not connecting it in
and it's just like a vicious cycle of me being alone and depressed and just
showing at my parents house doing nothing for three weeks
yeah and so I kind of wanted to get deeper into the actual story of what
actually was going on these past couple of weeks and why i cry why I haven't
been blogging and why have a music videos specifically like I said it was
because i was in a high-stress environment moving into my new apartment
trying to figure out this you know graduating with because i was supposed
to graduate and then I failed a class that I had to take a summer class
finished my summer class and I thought I graduated and they write what I think
i'm getting my diploma and I had anything like if you remember my weekly
blog i had way and i have my credits to graduate congrats i remember my weekly
blog i put that in there like yeah finally graduated well like a week after
that I get an email from my school saying oh no actually you're still
missing a credit you didn't graduate
meanwhile i'm like what I already moved away like what am I gonna do now I
thought I graduated I set up my whole life based on the fact that i graduated
i moved away from my school and everything and now you're telling me
that I didn't graduate and that just like oh just way down on me so heavy and
then moving into my apartment was like such a freaking nightmare and all the
financial stress of moving in and buying all this i spent like so many thousand
expert so many thousands of dollars on this apartment in the furniture and
getting the Wi-Fi and always did repeat and always different blah blah i was
feeling bad because i was stressing my parents out because my parents where the
mains ones who were helping move and it was like moving from stated it was just
so much going on then i have my relationship
oh I have argument with creating oh this isn't that it's just like too much going
on at once it was too much going on at once and it was like a one day something
happened and it was boom that was the last straw like that was last off and I
called my mom and I was like I can't do this I can't do this I need some help I
don't know what
going on and my mom is super super super super like supportive and has always
been a concerned parent has always been a parent that's just there when you need
her
you know whatever you guys have you guys can kind of see a little glimpse of my
mom like my videos and stuff you guys know how she is and so she came to
Dallas pick me up from my new apartment and brought me home to austin and was
like look you're gonna stay here in the comfort of our house and the comfort of
your parents and the comfort of your family and we're gonna get you some help
and we're going to get this figured out and you're just gonna stay here and
chill out and just you know step back from your own world a little bit friend
long as you need two inches take a break from social media take a break from
videos do what you need to do and so she's kind of the one who kind of you
know that's why I'm here right now i'm sitting on their porch right now and
like i said i've been here for like what like three weeks now
um and so basically whenever I you know she first got here I was doing bad when
I think I was doing bad i was doing like the worst I've ever been I've had panic
attacks and stuff before I've had really really low points like really spikes
depression so before but this was like on a whole nother level this was like
worst panic attack ever
I'm freaking out I'm to the point where I'm like so and it's something that's
really hard to explain if you if you don't struggle with depression if you if
you can't relate to this then you're just not going to relate to this like if
you're watching this video and you're just lost your just gonna be lost
because this really know what I can explain it to you it's just sometimes if
you struggle with depression sometimes even when it doesn't seem like you're
outside stuff is it doesn't seem like oh it's that bad but sometimes you get so
weighed down that it's literally the end of the world it's literally to the point
where you do not want to live you do not want to be on this earth you do not want
to feel this pain anymore you do not want to this depression anymore you do
not want to have these panic attacks anymore and it gets to be too
so much it gets to be so overwhelming that you feel it bubbling up inside you
you feel your body hurt you get sick you can't get up like it's crazy it's like a
true disease and that's where i was that and that's where i was feeling like I
don't want to live I truly felt that way I truly felt in that moment I don't want
to live and so my mom she saw that she saw how you know panicked i was and she
said we're going to the hospital
we're going to apple you need medical help this is not something that you have
control over this is not a game this is not a joke
you're going to the hospital and so I spent three days in the hospital
technically on suicide watch actually which is no laughing matter which is not
a job which is not a game but yes I was in the hospital
technically on suicide watch because i had checked in under those pretenses or
whatever and this is not me trying to get attention trying to be dramatic
whatever this is just truly me opening up to you guys I'm telling you guys this
is what happens in real life this is what really went down and it was a
terrible experience it was a really it was a nightmare it was a total nightmare
being checked my having my mom take me to the hospital she's so worried about
me that she's crying and she's concerned I don't know what to do myself I'm just
feeling numb at this point and there but you know I have the things on my wrist
and everything like I'm a truth and I've this is coming from someone who has
never been to the hospital for any reason I've never broken a bone
I've never had like pneumonia or anything like that so this is like my
first hospital experience and I kind of hate doctors anyway like it's scary just
going to the doctor just going to the hospital that by itself is scary
we're going to be mental whatever it's called section of the hospital is work
to me like going to the hospital for the first time in my life
going to the mental section of the hospital was just so scary and so like
just a mixture of being it's scary and heartbreaking and shocking and I just
didn't even it was just I don't even know how to explain it you guys like I
don't even explain but I was checked in and I spent all day in the first
hospital they were trying to figure out where we're to transfer me what to do
what to do blah blah blah and so finally late i was transferred to a different
facility and this facility was an overnight facility this was an inpatient
facility that means you're checked in
you can't believe we're keeping you here because we need to keep you here for
like a week because we need to watch you because we didn't do this and that and
you're actually checked in this is not just the check-in check-out talk to dr.
Lee know this is like you really being checked in to a facility a psychiatric
mental behavioral facility and yeah this is real life like this actually happened
it meets me telling the story right now it's like I can't even believe I'm
telling the story I can't believe that I'm like about to post this on youtube
but this actually happened I was checked in and they took all my stuff all of my
dangerous stuff all of my stuff and put it in this bag and took it away from me
and put in a locker whatever check me into the facility got me checked into my
room and I'm looking around and I'm literally seeing psychiatric patients
walking around in their little with their possible bracelets on with their
little hospital gowns on or their little Hospital pants and stuff
no shoes everyone has to just have socks on no jewelry they made me take out my
nose ring maybe take out on my earrings take off all my necklaces and stuff
because you can't have anything sharp you can't have anything and they checked
me in and I walk in there and it's like a hospital but there's like a little
main area where you can kind of just hanging out free leak and it was just
all these like patients like in there you see someone in the corner like
crying their eyes out you see someone in the corner talking to themselves like I
felt like I was in a movie like if you've ever seen a movie where it's like
a psychiatric hospital mental hospital and you see all the patients it
literally looks like that like this is real life it literally looked like that
and I'm just this whole time I'm not even like saying anything I don't know
what to think I don't know what to do
they're taking all my stuff is putting me he gave me a blanket and stuff like
that and they're just like here's your room
whatever you're going to speak to a doctor in the morning just try to get
some sleep
whatever whatever and I'm like I'm really here
I'm really in a psychiatric hospital right now I like it was
I'm speechless right now I don't even know how to explain it to you guys but
so that night I had to spend the night there and it was the worst thing ever it
was the scariest thing ever i'm in this cold dark hospital room it with out my
stuff but no could have my phone or anything no electronics no nothing
all my belongings are taken away i'm in this cold room by myself I don't know
these people
I don't know these these patients are just here around me and I have to leave
my door not allowed to close your door so i have to leave my door open and I'm
just trying to like get some sleep and all I hear throughout the hallways just
all this commotion some big commotion happened where one of the patients went
crazy and meet one of the other patients and it's like no green card green and
all this commotion is happening like I felt like I was in a movie you guys let
alone how I was already feeling inside myself like my own issues my own
depression my own reason why I was crying my eyes out but on top of that
being in this facility and like I felt like I don't even I don't even know
that's all I can keep saying is I don't even know how to explain it to you but
yeah that happened and I spent the night and I woke up and they brought me a tray
of discussing breakfast and I spent two more days there in a over the course of
the two days I spoke to like seven different doctors like seven different
doctors evaluating me like one doctor was like a nutritional least one doctor
was just like to check you physically one doctor was like a therapy is one
doctor was a psychiatrist who's really
kinda figure out what was wrong and what medication i needed there was another
doctor who was like something else like I literally spoke to like seven
different doctors there was a bunch of different nurses and stuff and they just
kept saying Raven we need you ready we need you and pulling me to different
rooms and pulling me two different like appointments or whatever
meanwhile i'm just like here with the rest of the patients there's probably
like 10 other patients in my little section and when i'm not talking to the
doctor I'm really just like getting to know these people and there are some
people in there who like I was ok I'm not gonna talk to you I'm not gonna mess
with you whatever but there are some people in there who I kind of could like
relate to who
it's not like they were crazy psycho people but they were dealing with
depression in the main he had a suicide attempt or for whatever reason that
they're here and we were kind of just talking to each other and hearing into
the story and they were telling you have you ever been to such-and-such hospital
have you ever got a guy and taken to such hospital and I'm like no this is my
first time anywhere never anyway welcome because you hate that is placing that
and they're like sharing their stories and other hospitals they've been to and
stuff like that and I'm just like I feel so out of place here I I'm just like
petrified and I was kind of just taking it in and listening to the doctors and
doing whatever the nurses told me to do because i realized that i was there for
a reason and I didn't want to just completely shut off at the same time I
was really really scared because it really felt like I was in a movie and
there was all this commotion going on
meanwhile i'm here because i'm already petrified I'm here because I'm already
emotionally disturbed so being thrown into this facility where it's even more
emotionally disturbing was just like an overload of sensation like I can't even
explain it to you guys but you know I got my little try to talk to dr. why i
only spent three days there when I was supposed to spend seven days when they
were really trying to keep me for like seven days was because I just couldn't I
was like this is it
looking like I know I'm here to get help i know this is a hospital i know this is
like their specialty and stuff like this but like I don't trust these doctors I
don't trust this facility
I need to get out of here but they tried to like keep you there because from the
from their mind from the doctors mind they're like you're the patient you
don't know you're talking about
of course you want to leave of course you don't want to be here but you need
to be here you need to stay here and you're on liability we can't let you
leave until the next seven days and I'm like you can like I was feeling like I
was being kept as a prisoner in a psychiatric hospital because they didn't
want to let me lead because they felt like that was their responsibility to
keep me there and help me and gave me treatment and like they didn't want to
let me use the phone to call my parents
it was honestly craziness like I had never like I I don't know but I finally
like I I told him I was like I want to leave let me call my mom let me tell her
what's happening let me tell her how I feel and let her come pick me up because
I you cannot stay here another day so it was really all this back and forth mess
and my mom basically had to like beg the people to let me out because it wasn't
like voluntary they had to dismiss you
so it was like all this craziness forefront of them finally to dismiss me
and my dad came and picked me up and i will have never been so happy to see my
dad in my life I have never been so ready to me a place in my life like when
they finally like let me through the last door I was like I felt like I just
got out of jail
like I literally have felt like I just got out of jail it was terrible was the
scariest experience of my life and the fact that i was in there because of my
depression because i had fallen so low and that I was actually in a psychiatric
hospital on suicide watch and they wouldn't let me leave i jizz I could and
this is all happening over the during the week we know ask me where's the
weekly blog why are you not doing weekly by where your videos what are you doing
where are you
well now you know now you know where i was about you some of you guys who were
leaving very strong comments kind of feel kind of stupid
down down
but so yeah I left there
I said that was like the first days of it so that was like the first week that
i was here in austin and then when they finally let me go and let me into the
care of my parents
I've just been at my parents house ever since and I've just been kind of working
with my mom to find other doctors find other solutions and i actually ended up
seeing a different doctor and actually i'm being prescribed a medication which
um the one of the whole reason why i was in that scary psychiatric hospital was
because it was like okay I think I really think I need to be on medication
like it's gone to that point now where I really think i need the help of
medication and so I was talking to all those doctors and i was there because i
thought they were gonna like prescribing medication i have never been on
medication in my life . like for anything only medication I've ever taken
is like tylenol or whatever birth control whatever but never have ever
been on medication in my life never really looked into it so now that I was
in like such a heated crisis or whatever i went to that place to try to get on
medication but it was since it was all that hoopla on I wanted to leave i never
got but after that like publix go
I did end up seeing another doctor who was more helpful and who actually did
prescribe me an antidepressant
so yes i have that now i am on an antidepressant and i've only been taking
it for a little while so i can't really say if it's helping or whatever whatever
but yeah there's that and I feel good about that and I feel like that's kind
of a step in the right direction and kind of I don't know I feel good about
it so hopefully that can kind of help me innocent but medication is what is truly
not just a magical cure you can't just like pop pills all day and be like okay
I'm not depressed like that's clearly unhealthy that's clearly not the answer
but it can help because I guess that depression is a health thing it is
something that's coming from inside of your body so medication can help balance
those chemicals out
balance how you feeling stuff like that with the help of actually working
through your problems actually going to a therapist actually you know doing
stuff outside of just taking a medication so there's that and i am also
looking into getting a new therapist and trying some new techniques and seeing
some different specialists and stuff like that so that's kind of why I'm
still in austin because I basically i need my mom's help and expertise and
support to help me find these doctors to help me get this help and to take me to
all my appointments and stuff like that so I've just been spending time here
doing that trying to get better trying to feel better and basically just like
being on this little rehab retreat like I described in the beginning so yeah
that's about as honest and as real and as specific as i can get at this point I
think I feel like everything should make sense now
to a certain extent and yeah but basically I just really whole reason why
like that like i said it was partially just to explain myself and just like
help you understand what's really going on that you know that I'm not just
abandoning you guys so that you know that I'm not just being lazy that you
know that like i actually have legitimate reason but also on the other
hand it's not it's about explaining myself is also about being transparent
being open and shedding light on a very important issue which is anxiety and
depression and even if it seems like you have a perfect life even if you have all
this stuff going for you if you have money if you have this apartment if you
have this YouTube channel if you have this boyfriend if you have all the stuff
people still struggle with depression regardless of all that stuff
and I really wanted to make this video to show that like even people like me
have depression even people like me end up in a psychiatric hospital end up
taking medication end up in this position and need help and so for any of
my viewers who are watching this I just want you to know that you are not alone
that's like the biggest number one think you are not alone you're not crazy you
are not a problem child you are not worthless you are not alone there are so
many other people in this world who are dealing with the same thing like this
same thing that you're doing with no matter how bad you think you have it
there are other people who have had it that back and who have gotten help and
who have gone through it and it's not pointless
it's not pointless and you're not crazy that's really what I wanted people to
get out of this is that it's okay to just say you know what yeah i'm
depressed i think i have depression i think i have anxiety and I think I need
some help and actually go out and tell somebody and actually go out and seek
the help and get on medication and see a therapist and check yourself into
hospital whatever you need to do to get that help to be healthy to stay on this
earth to stay saying to help yourself become happy do it because you're not
crazy and you're not alone and it's worth it's so worth it if I can do it if
I can go through it and I can you check with them i can on communication and
help and I'm still on my dream i'm still very much so on my journey
soon getting to that healthy . but i just want anyone who's watching this
shows with depression to just take away from this that you're not crazy you're
not alone
he helped me here we seek help
i will try to live whatever I find to give your information i will try to link
those down below it really starts with just telling someone speaking outside
i'm gonna tell your mom tell your best friend tell your boyfriend how you
really aren't feeling tell them that your concern tell them that you had
suicidal thoughts tell them whatever it is open up about and be honest and get
the help that you it's so important I don't want her to feel like they're
crazy they're worthless it's never going to get better it's pointless into end up
committing suicide that it's not worth it is not true true and so we wanted to
use my platform voltages say that to just show that there's look up to me I'm
just makes everything all the stuff about me but no real life i struggle
with depression and I had to go to the hospital and I'm I'm to the point now
where I realized that it's important
my life is important in my life is important
my health is important I deserve to get the help that I need I deserve to be
able to talk to somebody about it I
deserve to be able to see a doctor whatever whatever and I know what it's
like I've gone through things and other people who can probably relate with like
you just feel like you're not worth it like why should anybody care about me
why should anybody healthy
why should I bug my mom about this why should i why should i have not worked at
whatever i'm just gonna shut myself off and just soak it and it's so dangerous
to do that and I just don't want anyone to do that so I really wanted to make
this video to give you that spark of motivation to give you that feeling in
your heart that you're not alone and you are worth something you are worth the
effort
basically you are worth the effort to go and get help if you are struggling with
anxiety depression all those things because it's so much more common than
you think and there is help out there there is help and it's sometimes hard to
find the right home for get there is always worth a try it's definitely worth
the try your life your Hill able to work with you have to get to the important so
even i had to take a whole break from youtube and I was so like you guys I was
so upset because this the month of like August going into September this little
chunk of time right now was supposed to be an amazing chunk of time for me it
was supposed to be like the highlight of my gear so many amazing things were
supposed to be happening for me and I felt like it went all down the toilet
but like I disappointed myself and I was so that was just part of the reason why
was just so down on myself because I was like this is supposed to be a time when
I move into my apartment I supposed to be doing an apartment for right now I've
got to be going to volume event in downtown Dallas those be making all
these connect
doing this and I'm going to be traveling here and doing that doing this and these
sponsorships and all the stuff that i had planned for this month and this this
upcoming month or whatever it was just supposed to be like the best time in my
life and it was turned out to be the worst time of my life and I was not
prepared for that and I was so down on myself about that and I just felt like I
was disappointing so many people of disappointing myself now disappointing
you guys I was disappointing the brands and I suppose to be working within all
the stuff I just feel like a huge huge huge disappointment and it was just
heartbreaking it was so heartbreaking but i had to realize that too bad if I
have to I have to step away i have to leave my apartment I have to put my
videos on hold i have to put these trips and these events on hold because my life
my happiness and my health is more important i am more important and i have
to know that I am worthy and i am worth it to take this time off and get the
help that I need and you guys are too and that's what i wanted you guys to get
out of this so hopefully it does some good hopefully my message and my purpose
works and it gets out there that's really what I wanted out of this
yeah like I've kind of been saying i'm hoping to get back to my regular
schedule and back to my regular you know grind or whatever like next month like
in october is what I'm kind of planning for things to get more back to normal
then again I don't want to rush you or anything like that but yeah is this this
is not going to be the end of me not going to be the world's not going to be
going to ruin everything so I tab plans to push through to follow through to
make up for it so please stay tuned

emergency i'm just going through a family emergencies you guys have been
saying like oh I hope you know praying for your family and technically it
wasn't really a family emergency that's kind of just what i was saying cuz I
didn't feel like obviously explaining what was really happening but I was kind
of saying it was actually we did have a death in the family also during this
whole thing there was a death in the family says and other things though
technically kind of it was a family emergency also mixed in
yeah whatever it was just a lot but the support and stuff that you guys were
saying to me really does mean a lot i really do appreciate it
