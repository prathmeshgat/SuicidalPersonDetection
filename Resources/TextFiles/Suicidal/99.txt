hey guys and talking about a touchy
subject which is suicide attempt but
after that i'm going to talk about how
things are getting this was almost three
years ago and i was already suicidal
before that but what happened was I said
something I shouldn't have
word got around the school and I just
got so much heat and people saying
horrible things me feel so horrible i
cried I cried a lot that day
now let's like it that's kind of what
pushed me over the edge and when i got
home i cried my mom talked to me once it
was dark i went up to my room come to
just drink myself and my mom on me and
she stopped me about me on stairs and
talk to me was thinking about was I have
to end it now and my pain was under such
a close and you wouldn't be laughing
going to be able to do that then packed
and then I went to an inpatient psych
Hospital
that was the start of it into a more
cycles pose I gave up
I thought I was never going to get
better things but never get better in
that I would always have a bad like that
always be sad that always angry and kind
of recent wanted to change that I want
to live my life right now and right now
it's starting to get better but it's not
better yet fifty percent it's not even
five better
it's starting to and I want you to know
that you're suicidal
better
most people say this time time and I
know no one wants to wait
everyone wants it fixed and sometimes
you have to sometimes you have to wait
and you have to yourself make a choice
choice that you want to get better and
we'll leave it will happen because if
you don't believe you're not going to
try hard enough and it's not gonna
happen if you believe you will get
better and have a better life do it if
you sit like I want a better life but I
know it's never going to happen it won't
have to tell yourself and believe it but
it will end up being better and that's
going to take well hard work as long as
you work hard you will be able to get
better i know it's sounds top don't stop
to just live and sadness until it gets
better live still with that pain but as
long as you get help to talk to someone
try yourself to make it better and you
believe it
that's what else change
I don't know where I'd be four years of
high school when he was on drugs while
I'm in jail would be dead
no there's like I want to live and I
can't wait to put together i have to
make it better myself
it's hard people wanting to fall back
into the pattern of being upset dad you
have to learn that believe that you can
make a change your happiness because you
control that
so if you are suicidal right here the

are like just think right now there's
going to be a bunch of stuff in your
life that good
