hi guys this is a video that i actually never thought I would make because it's
so personal to me and I know I share a lot of myself with you guys but this is
a whole new level of personal and yeah I've seen a lot of comments recently
from people who are really said who want to give up on life and to just basically
feeling suicidal
I don't know if a lot of you know my personal story with suicide
I mean I haven't really shared it with that many people and I think now is the
time to share it because I'm scared for some of you guys and I'm scared for a
lot of people who are in my position that haven't heard this yet and i feel
like with what I've been through I have such a voice to talk about it and why
not use that I'm extra emotional right now because underneath that will be the
10-year anniversary of my brother deciding to leave the world
my brother was 18 at the time I was 11 I was still a kid I didn't know what was
going on he was there one day and gone the next
I know an 18 year old boy didn't think about his little sister when he decided
to take his life I was probably the last thing on his mind and I don't think he
thought about the way it would affect me but I think about him every day I miss
him every day I have him tattooed on my body
there will always be questions you always ask why why did that happen
no one knew he was going to do this didn't tell anyone and that's what
breaks my heart the most because from what I went through afterwards I know
that if you had told someone and confided and just opened himself up that
you probably still be here today
what happened with him was the first death had a very experienced and because
of that as I grow older and became a teenager and got all those crazy whore
and went through all these life changes and got really stressed oh and a lot of
pressure on me
the only thing I knew was suicide I was brave enough to reach out to someone
though and because i did that is basically the reason why I'm still here
she was always there for me she helped me and she's basically my lifeline and I
remember one day she said to me can leave you can't look for yourself right
now just live for me because I can't handle it i will not be able to handle
it if you take your life and you know what that worked for me because I hated
myself so much and disrespected myself so much but I didn't care i don't care
about myself but I care about her so much I didn't want to hurt her and that
was enough to just say okay i'll live for you but it's gonna be really hard so
i want to tell you that if you can't let yourself live for someone else even if
it feels like you don't have family or friends live for your pet live for your
cat live for something livery your favorite band
I know you can do that i know there's something in this world that you really
love and let her something you would miss if I had taken my life back
I wouldn't be here today making videos and doing what i really love to do I
wouldn't have met the people that I've met today I wouldn't have my adorable
cat I would never have met my nieces and nephews I would have never fallen in
love and had breakups and gone through terrible of amazing beautiful times I
wouldn't be breathing right now and I wouldn't have this one of my skin ever
again and i'm so happy i didn't do it i just want you to know even though right
now if you're feeling this way it'll feel like you're never going to get
better but you will and life doesn't necessarily get easier but you'll get
stronger and the older you get the more you'll be so grateful for your life just
hearing the birds singing
outside your window will be the greatest blessing and because you went through
this because you went through such a dark time you will come out of it the
most happy person effort that's only when you experience these extreme
negative emotions that you can feel the most extreme pleasure
dying is not an option for me anymore but I want you to know that it was it
was real so please just know I don't want to say it gets better because life
is supposed to be hard you're supposed to learn all these lessons but you will
get stronger and if you can't live for yourself right now but for something
else live for me live for a tree in your patch live for something please talk to
someone I did things differently than my brother I reached out i got help even if
it meant getting counseling that absolutely hated and going to hospitals
that made me go crazy even crazier than when I got in
they saved my life and my brother just talk to someone if he had just decided
to live from one person you'll be here today
you can do it you really can life is simply amazing and beautiful and you
deserve to be here if you do it your family will be asking life for the rest
of their lives
your family will be sad and heartbroken and every time it comes around your
birthday for the anniversary of your death or Christmas or weddings are going
to feel empty and said they're going to miss you and you won't be there to see
that you will not be there you have to understand that that's something that I
really didn't understand was that if i died i will be gone
I wouldn't see anyone go to my funeral I wouldn't see anyone being sad I wouldn't
see anything I would be dead I would be gone
your life changes so much and it will change
so much and one day it could be really beautiful and I bet is already beautiful
it's just the way you're looking at it I love you your family loves you and you
live yourself somewhere deep inside I know you do
just spread your you should
see one thing you know to show
