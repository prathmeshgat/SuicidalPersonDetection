you guys and welcome back to my channel so today it's a really hard a video for
me to film and I don't know exactly when i will post this and if it's going to be
wait
pass the time I film this but I really wanted to get this out there
I want to make this video because I've been honest with you guys
I haven't been myself for the past month and a half or two months I've been
uploading a time as you guys can tell and everything looks so perfect if you
guys look at my videos or if you look at me instagram or twitter I just I seem
like I'm so happy and that's not necessarily true
and yes i know i love fashion I love beauty
I love all that stuff and it's more something I like to do is a hobby but
that's not what I'm all about and that's not everything I like
and my passions are and and I want to be able to talk about things and talk about
issues that may affect other people and I want to be able to reach out to people
since I do have a platform here and it would be such a disservice if I just was
totally fake and didn't talk about things that did happen in life because
it can reach out to other people when I can help other people and in the end
that's what i want my channel to really do is to be a platform for people to
come and to kind of forget their problems but then also feel like they
can relate to me and that they're not alone and with whatever issue that
you're facing
I probably it should not have more miss cotton this video but you know
we're going to go with it after you guys can tell what the title
I recently was let go from my job and this was my full-time career that was
doing
aside from youtube is not just a little side job I was doing it was my career
i'll give you a little background about me I went to university and I got my
degree in psychology
i graduated a year almost a year and a half of ghosts
I'm not going to name anyone's names or the organization's name
I'm not going to say that I just want to get my story out there
this is probably gonna be a really long video so if this is not your type of
video then exhale and you guys will catch me in my next video which will
probably be a normal beauty or fashion related video but if you guys are going
to stay and watches you better have a snack because it's probably going to be
a super long one and I'm so sorry for that
i'll begin from the banning and telling you everything that led up to this
actually worked for this organization while I was doing my degree at my
university i attended i became a summer student when I was just 18 years old
which I was really fortunate because a lot of universities actually don't have
co-op when it comes to psychology it's pretty much you read books for four
years and then you graduate and then you're on your own but i actually was
able to become a summer student i just applied and I got it to give you a
background of what i did i worked with clients that had mental health issues
and they had they were the dual diagnosis so they had a mental health
issues whether it was bipolar schizophrenia depression and they were
also developmentally delayed so they had multiple issues with them and it was
seriously my passion
that's what I wanted to do I want to help people that have issues whether
it's addictions or mental health issues and things like that that was my passion
and
you I wanted to do that since I was 13 years old which is crazy because a lot
of people don't know what they want to do but I always knew I wanted to help
people and get in that field I got and when I was 18 years old and I did a
summer position also my work there for 40 hours a week and i loved it I loved
the place I was in I there's different locations for this organization and that
location i was in i absolutely loved it I loved the clients I love the people I
loved my coworkers
I just loved the whole atmosphere it was so much fun and it was such a great
experience and I was learning while I was going to school summer came to an
end and I was really sad because just because you were a summer student
doesn't mean you'll get a job after your a summer student
it's not all the time summer students end up becoming part timers
but my supervisor loved me and he told me to apply as part time and I'm so
excited I applied and I got the job there right after so i started working
after that summer I stopped in the end of august i believe and then I became
officially part time at the very beginning of october i was 19 at this
point when I was a part timer and I was going to university and doing that as a
part time job and I was actually doing three things so i was going to
university I was doing that part time I also worked at the gymnastics coach and
I also was doing YouTube on the side which my youtube was just starting up so
I didn't really have much people but I was trying really hard because I didn't
want to do
youtube I love psychology and I love helping people but i am also very
creative i love editing
I love shooting videos and things like that that's always I've always been
creative as well so kind of give me like a hobby to do on the side of my actual
job is going to school and I was part time for the next three years or couple
years while i was in school I graduated
and unfortunately the place that I was doing my part time hours
we're starting to cut people's hours because clients are starting to leave
and when that happens the part-timers have to kind of lose their hours because
the full timers have obviously seniority over the part-timers
so I decided to go to a different location
I heard a little bit of things about this location i heard the staff could be
a little bit gossipers and but you can't really judge based on what other people
said so I said that I wanted to try it out for myself and I actually did quite
enjoy it I didn't love the clients there as well and the co-workers were a lot
there were people that I really did like working there and they're sincere and
genuine people and they need my time so much fun going into work so
and the one thing i really like to about this location is that it was super
convenient for me because it was super close to my house could film youtube in
the morning or after my work and then I could go to work and it was super
convenient for me so i was doing i worked there for a year part time and I
was going crazy amount of hours working 60 70 80 hours a week sometimes and at
one point my manager
I'll color a manager but pretty much she had to go on leave for a month and my
supervisor at that location really liked me and really thought I was a good
worker and actually asked me to take her position for the not month in a little
bit after and I was so happy and excited just because I thought that would be
such good experience for my resume since I was so young and at this point i was
20 or 21 21 I believing people would really mind
i just don't really think about that i just thought i would look really good on
my resume for me since I am
young and just really was no I was the youngest person in this organization I
believe when i first started i started at 18 and most people are in their
thirties or late thirties to their fifties
that's like the main range so i was quite younger than everyone so it was
really impressive for me to be in an organization and already doing so well
because a lot of my friends from university didn't really find jobs and
psychology field right after they had didn't have any experience was getting a
ton of hours and i loved it i build such good relationships with clients and I
was starting to feel like I fit in when I did get that lady's position for that
month in a bit
that's when things , - quick return I was taking your position i was doing
some many hours a week for that whole month and a half and or month in a bit
and that's when people started to really talk about me
people were I guess mad that my supervisor gave me that opportunity
though I was not getting paid anymore
nothing it's just I was working crazy amount of hours and I just thought it
was a good experience i didn't do it because i want to get paid mor I just
wanted to have that on my resume so i thought that was really good at it
differently think about what the consequences would be if i took that a
lot of people were talking about me
not everyone obviously but there were some people that we're starting to talk
behind my back and they were really going to bring me down and go down to
the supervisor and complain about any little thing but would never say
anything to me
I even had people there that i would say hi
ask them that question and they would straight out ignore me and turn their
back on me and walk away and I didn't understand what I did because I didn't
know people would treat people like that especially since i am so much younger
than them and they are some of them
my parents age and I wouldn't think that my parents would treat someone like that
thought it was so unprofessional and a lot of that was going around but I kind
of ignored it because I would go home and have my own separate life
a lot of people at that job obviously they were near their same age group so
sometimes they become friends and then we can go outside of work but since i
was so much younger
I just kind of went to work worked really hard did my job and then I would
go home and see my friends who were in your mage groups i kinda separated it
but it was getting really stressful for me because the job itself can be super
stressful for anyone that's in my field it can because you are working with
clients that have a lot of multiple issues and it can cause emotional
distress on you already so it's really important top be safe and happy work
environment where everyone can can depend on each other because the job
itself can already be stressful
I was starting to get a little stressed and burnt out I was working crazy amount
of hours and I wasn't having fun going to the job and more because of what
people were saying about me
I just kept going and it started to get a little better people are still talking
about me but I'm starting to just ignore it and I would I had good relationships
with other co-workers and they really made me feel happy and made me feel
important and like I was part of the team
I enjoyed going then that me so I did it for that year and then at me
there's actually a open position for full time and that manager that I took a
position for the month actually kept on you know apply and I need to apply and I
applied and I
the position but during this time he actually got a new supervisors
so my old supervisor that give me that position for manager that was working in
that location moved up and I got we brought in eight new supervisors
so that's when everything took for a turn
she came in and one thing I didn't tell you in this story is we had one client
at my organization that was really really really fixated on me
this client was autistic and if you guys know
autism autistic clients get very fixated
but it wasn't to the point where it really affected my clients daily
programming
it just kind of would get annoying to people because all my clients a is
Nicole Nicole Nicole this knuckle that cool this and when my new supervisor
came in she didn't like it she said this needs to stop
and we need to stop this closet and all of us and the co-worker said this is who
this client is this client is autistic and that's where they are they get
fixated on people
I am a young female and this has happened before with other females this
client gets fixated on females
I actually worked really well with this client I enjoy working with this client
so much you have no idea
and that's why this is so hard for me because I got so attached to the clients
because you spend more time at work than you do at home
it's a really hard i was working for a few months and everything was going well
I thought I was doing really well I thought I was doing a great job
I was a really dedicated worker i would sometimes called doubles or triples one
time I even right before i actually was like oh I worked a shift from 3pm all
the way to nine in the morning straight know Greg's worked it and I did they
that about five times since i was hired full time
sometimes when they really need to me since I was so close i would come in at
midnight
it and do things for them very passionate about helping people and I
really enjoyed working
everyone thought my work notice that even my supervisor so that was going on
so i'm going to fast forward so everything was fine and I worked and
then it came to this one monday where there is this one ms calf and for some
reason apparently she didn't like me
I had no idea she didn't like me because I used to talk to her she was one of the
people I was never like super close with people on my work where I would hang out
with them after because of my age difference but she was one person that I
was like acquaintances with I was like hey how are you and we just look where I
thought we had no issues like I never knew she didn't like me or something
it was really blind siding so pretty much what happened was started getting
more ships within the past month or a few weeks at our work because she wanted
more shifts so she was starting to get more ships there and then a lot of drama
happened once that was occurring
it was for people on shift and she was one of them
I was one of them and there's two other males this was eight evening shifts so
it was just us four in the location and it was really good the ship was just
like a normal monday shift and this is going to sound crazy to you guys so it
sounds crazy to me and my family and my friends so I know it's going to sound
crazy you guys because when my friends and family had to deal with this
they their minds were blown so this is the story i was in a room with a male
stop and I was picking something up and my nail ripped off because my nails are
super long
and it just it ripped off and pretty much a route completely off that
happened I ran downstairs to because it her and I was trying not to be like out
really loud so I ran downstairs and I would wiped it underneath the sink
because it was bleeding because pretty much my whole nail flew off and then
this male staff came down to see me was like are you okay
and I said yeah don't worry about it I'm fine so the mail stop one back upstairs
and after that happen
I went upstairs I wanted to the office I grabbed a band-aid
because my finger was bleeding and then I put it on and then I did my thing and
I get a call from my supervisor which is really strange because it's really late
at this point at night and that never happened my supervisor asked me if me
and that mail stop are ok and if we're fighting and is something happened and i
said no i was so confused why she was calling and how did she even assume that
ended up being that female stop that called and when I was in the washer
saying that this mail stuff had assaulted meet and be beat me up
essentially and that she was scared for her life
next day I didn't know about this until another staff came in after i was done
my shift and talk to her and that's what she said to him and then that's how you
lie my boss called me ever since I day
my boss called me the next morning when I did have a shift and then you're not
coming into work and you can't come in because there's an investigation and I
was just like why can't I come into work
I didn't do anything she was like there's an investigation there's an
allegation mean and you need to come into work
you can't come in to work now and she actually questioned my care
her and said I don't know why you didn't call me right after shift
who doesn't do that nice that because I didn't know what was going on and i
wanted i thought i could just come into work the next day and talked to you with
the situation because nothing happened
shit there's another guy that was on shift it was actually near the female
that called me but didn't know he called she called me because heat she went
outside to make the call and he was on shift and he can even a test and told my
boss
nothing happened it was a good shift that night there is no issues obviously
if I was assaulted i am a small girl and the person that appeared he assaulted me
is six foot four and is 15 years older than me
one in to get interrogated I went into the main offices and it was time for me
to get interrogated since there was this allegation
when i was there they didn't really tell me why I was getting out interrogated
didn't tell me what the allegation was but I just knew because of what any
staff member told me what she said
you that the reason why was because i apparently got assaulted
and when I was in there
they were really tearing me apart then they started safe
are you with this male staff and take in the eye and 23
I was 22 near the time and this male staff is 36 and i know some people go
with big age difference but I'm 23
I and he has kids and a family and that's that would never ever occur for
people to make up the rumors
it's like high school to me so I'm being interrogated asking if I'm with this
mail when he apparently insulted me and then they're looking at me and my
supervisor is making straight up
lies to me saying this happen this happen i said no we did it and then she
says don't like you know it did and it was in front of another managers
obviously the bosses word is going to take over me was in there and was
humiliated and I was so upset because I even said I'm a hard worker
I always work hard on my job I didn't do anything wrong i love the clients there
and I do my best for them and i only do everything that's in the best interest
for my clients and they said to me
we know you're a hard worker we're not questioning that but it's not in the
best interest for you to be fighting with another staff in arguing and I told
them I am NOT arguing with another stop and nothing happened that may yet they
kept saying you should be doing that and the crazy thing that got one female that
told me she got into a full-out fight in front of my clients yelling fight with
another female coworker just that friday and she told me on the Monday and it was
a full-blown argument and the supervisor that was on called knew about it because
they called each other like little high school girls and I brought that up
I said how about that argument that happened on friday with those two
co-workers and all they said to me was we're dealing with that
however both those co-workers still work at that place now
apparently i'm out because I argued with someone who I didn't argue it and
someone apparently a salted meat and I got fired an interrogation I went home I
was so upset because i could not go to work
I couldn't do anything about it and they said they need to investigate more
interesting and more and i know that the a certain stock members and staff
members said that my relationship with that co-workers professional and nothing
happened not shift
yeah I came in that friday
and they told me to do to further investigation we decided to terminate
your position
the night supervisor push the kleenex box to my face and then the human
resources person gave me my package and that's all they set then tell me why I
was going like oh they didn't tell me anything and just out of nowhere
done that's it even though i did so much for the organization working 80 hours a
week working doubles and working from 3pm to 90 and sometimes and coming in
when it was in my shift just to fix things and you're just done you can't
say bye to anyone you can't say bye to your clients
I could say bye to my client who was who I was their primary I could say bye to
any of my reputation just looked horrible
you made it seem like I was with some older man and he assault and disgusted
that that stuff goes on and I lost it a few weeks before i lost my job i
purchased my first partner you guys can see the log i purchased my first card
and I booked a vacation to Las Vegas before I was fired
I was devastated you work in this field you can't be up to attach the clients
but you know you will because you spend so many hours with that way and you
helping them I gave its been feeling that you get by helping people
you feel like you're actually making a difference you're putting positive
energy into the world when you're helping people one thing I am think
before is having my parents support definitely gotten a lot closer with my
family and obviously it's taking on toll on my family because they don't want to
see their daughter like this and they were really shocked and disgusted to
wish that they could do something and when I was like oh I taken through a
little bit of a depression and still am not the happiest person or I'm not fully
up healed yet but
you feel like you worthless and you feel humiliated
I felt humiliated I felt worthless and i still feel embarrassed and disgusted at
the same time and I feel anger because I'm so mad at that
female co-worker I'm so mad at my supervisor or my boss to even do that to
me and knows how hard of a worker and how much I've done just so disgusted by
that whole organization i would have never want to represent again to know
that they ruin people's lives like that and they're so quick to ruins people's
lives to good people
when I spent years in that organization
it sickens me and I want my story out there because it's not fair that should
happen to anyone and don't just saying it's not for me
it obviously happens in the world and I was so blind to this and it needs to be
put out there but I don't want to eat
I just want to sleep in bed
I should wish this could be all one big night here but I wake up every day
knowing it's real and I know that I'm young and I will eventually move on and
hopefully find another job which it is very difficult
I've been trying that's another day you graduate with University and you think
oh I'm going to find a job now I have a degree that you wanted and you can't
even find a job that everything happens for a reason and I know I'll bet you
thought another job and I'm young and I have my whole life out there
it just it really puts you in such a down mood and i had a full-time career i
finally bought my first car and my life was going so good i was so happy
everything just changed in a heartbeat like I would have
never thought this would happen I can't believe things like this happen to
people in the world and not there's nowhere for someone to turn and there's
nowhere you can't do anything about it and it's not fair not fair how much
power these organizations have over you
how do i had a family or house and we're going to be on the streets right now I'm
so fortunate that I have my family because if i move down on that job
I would have never thought I could just you lose it like that and if I moved out
i would be so screwed right now I know this was super long and I'm so sorry but
that is my story and I want to get it out there and I don't know what this
will be posted and i'm really nervous to post this because I've never posted
something like this before my channel and I've never been this open and both
are both to you guys but I want you guys to know because I don't want to be fake
anymore and I want you guys to know the truth of how I've been feeling and who i
am and i'm not just this person that like Beauty and superficial things i
actually have passion for other things in my life I've always wanted to help
people but to health issues and i love doing it and when I'm working I know I'm
good at it and I know I hope people and I feel good about it i don't think this
should be happening to anyone but there's so much emotional suit stress
and you have no support
just no support you just have to be there by yourself and you have to try
get back on your feet dick smith out good and they really brought me down
emotionally
eventually i'm not going to let a liar and manipulative people do this to me to
pick my feedback up i'm going to show them that it's their loss
people are bringing you down and you're having issues
just know that you're down know but things will get better
i'm still at that stage or down but i know that i will get base out back up
and I want you guys to do that - because no one deserves to be unhappy their
whole life one chance at this life to make it right and do what you love and
don't give up on what you love
no matter what that love
this you will you love and do what you're passionate about and do the
things that you want to accomplish in this life and don't let other people
tell you that you can't do it because you can so i hope you guys enjoyed this
video
I know is his super long wood and I didn't need to do that and i kinda
nervous suppose this I don't know what it will be up
I really hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope it gets out there or help someone
because everyone deserves to be happy and no one deserves to be brought down
no matter what I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll have a new normal video
probably the next video and I really hope you guys enjoyed this video
it's really hard for me to film and I'm gonna have a lot of editing to do but i
hope you guys enjoyed it and I put new videos every single week and don't
forget to click that subscribe button it would seriously make my whole day you
guys have made me so happy if i didn't have YouTube right now I'm telling you
guys I would be such a where state right now in my life so you guys have been
making this so much easier meet you may be so much happier you have no idea
and all your support means the entire world to me because you have brought me
to where I am now
and without you I would be in such a worse state in my life and I'm thankful
that at least have something to look forward to and it's you guys and
entertaining you guys and putting content out for you guys just know if
someone's trying to bring you down
don't let them for you down get back up and that's what you need to do and I
still feel like I'm Donna I know this is the first step for me to finally realize
that
things happen to good people sometimes in the world and you just need to learn
from it you need to grow from it and become a better person but i think this
out there is my first stop to realizing that it was not my fault
I could have done anything different these people knew what they were doing
and they knew they wanted me gone
I can no longer blame myself anymore and hosting this
I'm acknowledging that because I've been down for far too long now and I need a
pick myself back up and I need to do it because i am a strong person and I know
so many things are going to come for me in the future and as well as you guys
because take this advice and I'm telling you just don't let anyone bring you down
I know how hard it is
I loved working and I loved my field and I loved helping these clients they are
amazing people all the clients that I've how they're amazing people and people
sometimes need help and people need that person to lean on and I loved being not
and i wish nothing but the best for all my clients and I will never be able to
say goodbye but I know that they'll be great and not there in some good hands
and I loved a bunch of my co-workers that were there that were supportive
towards being nice to me and I could never thank them enough
what sickens me if there's still being like I said to me about me there and i'm
not even there anymore unfired and i'm still being talked about so it just
shows you how these people who they really are and maybe one day to learn
for themselves to not be that kind of person but I do believe in what goes
around comes around
and I know that right now i may not be at my happiest and I may be brought down
but I know eventually i will see the reason why because i know i did nothing
wrong
I'll catch you guys in my next video bye
