hi guys welcome back to my channel so it is almost the end of the year and I
thought I will come on here and I would do a very deep topic that I have
honestly recorded a few times before even last year 2014 i recorded it twice
and I thought you know what people are going to think i'm either crazy or
seeking attention or whatever so i'm not going to post it but you guys understand
how my channel it works now actually I should so much deep things about myself
on his channel which is inspired and helped you so hopefully this video will
be insightful and I want to get it done in 2015 I don't want to post it in 2016
because i want to enter 2016 positively this is not negative but I mean it's not
exactly the most light hearted topic that I'm speaking about you are so and
that's why I feel it's really important for me to kind of just get over the way
I'm going over and done with this channel so I'm i briefly spoken about my
issues with depression and I've always said i will come back and do a full
video with it and give you my personal story
I did speak about in one of my weights the Giro something to do about them
being bullied and fast often i did mention even as a child I suffered from
depression
now this is something that I only discovered kind of a bit later when I
realized what depression was and i'm talking about in my adulthood like this
a couple of years ago I looking back at my life and I hold on this looks like
the symptoms I had even as a child class depression
now i'm from my research depression has different types there's a low medium and
high and I think that was for me is kind of something that at least one person
will encounter at some point in their life and that probably it's just even
though feeling unhappy or you know when you just can't reason with yourself and
you just get grumpy
it may not last long time it's very easy to get over I guess
depending on the kind of you find in what is the best solution for you and
medium type of depression would have to be something in regards to
so much triggered it so let's say a bereavement all kind of a letdown a
terrible breakup and going through divorce or you know something of such no
personal nature and I think sometimes things like that don't do does need
therapy
depending on the situation for it to kind of be cured and then a severe and
that's the highest point of depression
it probably is different types of depression as well im just looking at
the free in which is kind of crosses the normal ones
so there can lead to lead to suicide or at least even suicidal thoughts
it could even have issues in regards to your your memory you're going to get
memory loss and people become anorexic bulimic or wherever they overeat comfort
eat whatever it becomes very severe and almost becomes absolutely uncontrollable
and it takes over your life and you feel that you actually putting yourself in a
dark hole and putting a lid over it and never speak into the world again
well that was my level of depression
wait i always want me to death if i wanted to do and i'm just going to get
into that in a minute
so I'm as a briefly spoke about as a child depression or something that I
encountered even as a very young child and my family probably would even know
this
um I used to have suicidal thoughts I used to always have always been
sensitive person so even if it's something as little as getting told off
I will feel so down and so terrible about myself to the point where i was i
feel that i would need to go to the top of a building or something and John half
literally as a child those are the crazy thoughts I used to have and as an
adolescent team as well and I've always told you I think my weight played a key
role and it's not just my weight per se is how I felt about
wait at least that's why I realize now how I felt about how i looked that
really bothered me have been bullied a lot as well that's contributed towards
depression because of my parents and you know school kids can be so mean girls
can be so mean and people will just say so much awful things about you just to
make you feel so awful and I guess as I said the insensitive that really got to
me I have tried to commit suicide twice as a teenager I my family doesn't even
know this is the first time I've ever speaking to anybody in the world about
this
I down some pills I downed quite a bit of pills and our . and it failed
I i ended up kind of just being a rosy and very dizzy and I remember I went to
sleep and woke up and I remember it fade and I was like why did it fail should
have just taken me and I didn't have any more so kind of down to top it up so you
can get one and i also tried to slit my wrists
I remember when my sister's boyfriend at the time found me actually that field
also because i didn't get the thing
so am i I've never been pleased with myself never been happy within myself
I just think you know when you just feel that you're just a you don't understand
what you're walking up that was the fault i literally carried constantly
that
why am I here what's my purpose my BM I haven't liked did I'm just worthless
I've always had that for about myself
that's you know depression kind of can go in waves and for me that's how it's
been so there's been times where I've in the principal accessing one or two one
year for a few months and then I'll be okay
then it will come back for another three months or a year or two years they'll be
fine but the main span of depression for me was over a period of five years five
good years and I think I'm after about five years that's where I discovered my
problem and decided to work upon it and that was it
my pregnancy with the manual when I was probably many well I've already told you
guys a story and the father hears his biological father did not care
he just abandon us and he's left us and that's alone just make me feel very no
of course it was naturally any woman will feel very discouraged from that and
the parking lot to be honest as well um my family wasn't insert much support and
I understand why because they were very disappointed in me i had just finished
University and you know my friend we have high hopes for me and stuff and
personally I didn't have any kind of false hopes for myself I had plans off
the words just because when the mail came he came out unexpectedly and ended
up with a host of disabilities that set me back in life but my family was
disappointed to me so imagine my pregnancy was very lonely and dark in
the first place and all i remember doing was crying
I remember even my sis estimation now every single night I heard you crying
out your whole pregnancy so it was no surprise that in the end
hey man you okay my eyes he came up because i was just not happy I was happy
with my pregnancy also in love my baby I can't lie you know how you feel when
you're pregnant like oh my god I'm having a baby but because nobody kind of
cake and about me
I think that's what got me very very low in the end and Emmanuel came early
I don't I don't think is the actual specific cause to be honest with you but
it definitely was a huge thing that had to go through my pregnancy with him now
have already told you guys a story but I haven't told you in depth and manuals
board very early
he was born at 23 weeks and if you're 23 weeks in pregnancy that is my viable for
life
he was taken to the neonatal unit and he was there for a period of six months in
an incubator i was there every single day
and despite my depression and my ways of feeling so low i honestly would say i
strengthened for him while he was in hospital
i strengthened for that child and i was there every
good day for him it was the most hardest thing I've ever had to go through to be
honest I'm to see my child fight for his life and that's what it actually was and
I think what made the depression really trigger even more was when I was hit
with reality
imagine for six months after he was born he was in the hospital the nurses
doctors everywhere and then when he comes out and he was taken to the
Children's Ward before he was fighting discharged and you can come home
he was an oxygen and that meeting other nasal tube for his nose he could hardly
breathe because he had some issues with his lungs and that was the first time I
was just me and this boy like he was in the bed and they're like a baby bed
thing and I experienced postnatal depression postnatal depression is when
you kind of really feel so low off having a baby
butterfingers despite my presence of depression kind of my first impression
was that
how do I deal with this this child is is is is a newborn pretty much although he
was six months old he was a newborn
because i am he came out at a time where i was due to have him
I'm by the same time he's so poorly so so poorly
this is my first child I'm only 21 what do i do and i just turned 21
lets you have just done to anyone no just hoping to ya
and I just didn't have a clue what to do with them and i think i think from that
start I thought I saw myself as a failure or do I know looking back that I
really did strength or not at that time because who else is that child and rely
on apart from me that child relied on me so I did what I could
I tried I fought and I don't want to do as a mother and I don't know why I just
I thought I was doing good enough
you know from that Emanuel is very very poorly that people don't realize the
extent to his illness
I've never ever said this before i don't think i have probably my second
more recently actually Emmanuel is blind Emmanuel has developmental delay that
means as issues with his motor skills and all sorts he is a six-year-old that
acts like a one year old and he doesn't talk he does
hum songs very clear audio songs he hums um he has a very violent temper tension
and temper tantrums that causes him to literally be a terror and these are
called this is called challenging behavior and I remember when he was in
hospital did say that how his MRI scan proof that there was an abnormality in
his brain so that may result in that and what I'm telling you he constantly
constantly pinches and scratches people and himself he bangs his head but at the
same time I always count my blessings and that is because he's not cabbage
I at least have a child there's women out there who try daily to have children
and they haven't had any i have got a child and regardless of his condition
I've decided to accept him I'm understand that I just need to support
him in whatever he's going through and that's exactly what I've done
so about one funny thing is i think because we all used to the social media
world and seeing people's kids and stuff which is not a problem at all but i
think some of people who follow me to get kind of a little bit discouraged I
don't show me man was notch or this is the reason i said he's blind he has a
cloud in his eye
that's not very pleasant for me to just take a picture and put it on Instagram
you go I mean we've got people comment in the same harsh things to him if
people can attack me how about my child
you know I'm i also and had a comment say no you're living a lavish life and
stop when the
because I'm going to New York and I have my husband and I never show my son and I
don't care about my son
you know these are the judgments that used to get thrown at me that recently I
even said to my mom
I'm gonna take him on your back and actually go to that point on instagram
do videos of him and stuff just so people can stop kind of bullying me
again
that's not saying stuff like oh you don't care about him and I and my moms
like you're so stupid that are you really going to go to kind of stop your
plans because exactly that's what you need to do you want your own cosmetics
exactly you want to carry on with this you really think you can do that with
many well when I was I'm here free and healthy living in two minutes away from
you when you come from school he comes and stays here has it did not go to bed
and that's it while you get to work and you want to stop that because of what a
random person on the internet or even in our realizes said that's ridiculous you
know and that's the thing no one sees what happens when the cameras off and
that is why i don't want to show that part of my life on the internet because
it's really really deep like the daily care of the manual is so complex and
that's what led up to the breaking point of me and with depression because it is
so so much he has literally destroying of 10 grown men as well and I don't know
why and how we got that but he lets get kicks and farms and slaps and scratches
he's a some would say he's darker and terror child is not always very
challenging and all of that is led up to so much
so why i said it's not just me that i can raise his child we all have to raise
him we all have to bring in our part and if you're not fixed again do you can't
deal with him
unfortunately not I'll be so wanted to do i'm not a thick skinned person I
really on
I'm very sensitive so I'm so grateful that someone who's my mother's side to
support me in that nature
you know because she knows that is very much for me to handle
you know um I'd you know it's not gonna be like that forever i have plans you
know as a mother I'm working on ways to kind of build in life for our entire
family
to be honest I this whole experience made me understand my child in his needs
anyway so I know knows how to handle them because i was able to work on
myself and work on my issues with depression when Emmanuel this play up is
really nothing to me now do you know I'm saying that the moment
this is what from my mother is definitely much needed in order for me
to work and things just generally for our future
so my depression was quite severe as i said i had a host of things happening to
me
I'm including like even memory loss if you read if you see that I kind of
jumped on my words are all the time and I say the wrong things
I remember my doctor say in that was caused from depression and i'm having
people about you , - don't you know you said that you submit and I've had it and
it actually was being called from depression you don't realize the actual
other medical things that depression can actually do to you and I had I was
always confused
I can never fixed rate i was constantly crying will be times where I will tell
my phone
i would also my door I would just like she shut myself off and have a cover
over my head
I just cry and cry and cry and cry and one thing about depression as well if
you have been depressed before you would know that when you cry so deep to the
point where you even all you get into that state of darkness when you enjoy
being in that darkness so weird
you want to get out of it but then again it's like I find a kind of feel
confident confident in being in that say everybody just leave me alone to be
depressed
that's how it was i also had a fear of people
oh yeah if you don't know you can have a fear of people i had a few people i
think i want to do a video about that
I was scared of people I can't trust people I used to think that everybody is
a reason for my troubles in this world
honestly which is really ridiculous but I
just didn't want to speak to people i used to think of anyone comes around me
that they were going to do something I was so paranoid
it was disgusting and all I could do was crying and crying and crying and I tell
you what did stop me from committing suicide at the time was the fact that i
had this child who would be this child's mother who would love him and raised him
like how i do or anyone at least for me
no one could know I got to be there for that boy
the break-in points was just after my wedding
literally a week after my wedding something happened in our personal lives
I ended up in hospital I need manual and ended up in the hospital as well
he was sick we have something with his stomach he had some issues with stomach
muscles and other reason but that was the literal breaking point where I was
like I can't do this anymore i'm done this and that's when my mom stepped in
as obviously I was sick Emmanuel was quite thick as well my mom stepped in
and she said she know I need to do this you need to get yourself together and i
think i remember we have a family meeting
I don't specifically speaks my sister right and I told my sis starch
Bernadette I always had these issues my entire life and she's actually know what
actual pics to start I always knew that you had a problem she just kept it so
real to me
his action al you've always had some sort of something wrong with you about
their you've just never been a normal child you've always been hyped or
something something's always bothers you
what is it and you know I'm glad that you've discovered what it is or whether
you're discovering but yeah I feel that if you don't act now because my problem
was always people are going to judge me saying about mother
if like I walk somebody else to come and help me that
my mom or anybody I have to deal with the manual myself
she said if you don't do that you are going to be a bad mother so take the
support that is being offered to you and run with their and that's what happened
that was the same time I said you know what I really need to delve deep and
find out what is really wrong with me so I went online and something told me to
type of depression symptoms or something of that nature and I've done online
depression test i don't know i think it was the NHS and I've done a test and you
know what it was like 24 hours 25
it actually was 25 25 and as I said previously scenes video there are levels
towards depression there's levels in your diagnosis and clearly haven't 24
out 25 hours at the severe state and I was in tile that's another thing is I
wasn't big denial because one question on that test was
do you feel that you are and suicide or do you feel like death
do you think of death often and stuff like that and i actually clicks no
because I couldn't bring myself to actually admitting that that was one of
my issues as well because it was definitely something calming for me so I
went to my GP which is my doctor and my doctor took the same test
she obviously has a higher version again I scored that to anyone else many tools
something like that kind of missing that really important question but obviously
with myself and you
I knew that I was bitchy a hundred percent on that depression test and
something was severely wrong
now my doctor gave me two options she's like either you take a take some antioch
and Ireland prescribed an antidepressant pills and you can go on the course of
anti don't antidepressant pills or you take therapy or you can do both
it's totally up to you but if I'm honest with you I prefer my patients to go
through therapy because you know what I know you can do this and I love my
doctor until this day for every medical issue I've had throughout with
manual with myself everything she just held my hand and she's been such a huge
support and she just told me the truth and she tells me that things that things
are not necessary but i feel that a lot of doctors be like oh you need is you
need that you need to do this and she's like a lot of things are not necessary
we are human beings we can get over a lot of things if we only just have
determination
so I've had one for repossession it was ok but to be honest I just still felt it
wasn't good enough
I'm and therefore it got so kind of self-discovery that I need to be happy
but how does
I call i don't know any other way of explaining this to you but I had to find
my own true happiness
I had to find a way of just saying
regardless of where biomass in this life
I got to be content with that so I'm this was not this was like just before I
got pregnant with twins
I decided to start working on that so if you recall
um I took a you to break i was awful at nine ten months I was all social media
and everything
depression was actually kind of like that for the first let's say six or so
months and then I came back with my wedding and stuff like that
surprise me my pregnancy with the twins I wasn't really depressed
in fact i wasn't i was just i think i was very nervous
if I'm honest with you I don't have any mental issues per se but I was
definitely physically unfit and that's another reason why mom stepped in and
decided to take full control of the manual because I was such a bad way
through my pregnancy to be honest with the twins
no no surprise that ended up as it did because arm
I wasn't very fit I wasn't fit and then I needed to support as much as possible
and it just as as it goes that since that happened and I lost twins obviously
I was so sad
obviously obviously didn't see on camera and obviously i really really really
really got down there
and I did feel a little bit of depression if I'm honest but not to the
point where it was going to break me I knew that I will gather it because i had
gotten out of it before and I was working on myself another on my journey
to find holes and happiness
so no I'm not gonna even let the death of the twins destroy my you know my
happiness or my long-term happiness and I and it didn't do that
it didn't do that in a long time my mom and I guess what I recuperated and kind
of got myself together and decided you know what I'm going to go back to work
