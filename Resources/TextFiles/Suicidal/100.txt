hi everyone welcome back to my videos
sorry it's been so long since my last one
I've been so busy and it's so difficult to actually fill in these videos because
I've got to relive everything that I went through to remember how to try and
help everyone so yeah please bear with me but i will continue to get videos up
today I'm gonna do a short video on suicidal thoughts and this video is is
the sole purpose of it is for the people with having all have had that so that
have had those thoughts
it's just it's one of the worst things you can think and feel and I want to
talk about my experiences with it especially in light of what's happened
with robin williams recently which is horrible but it's a serious serious
issue needs to be talked about and help prevent it
I'm sorry the video comes across badly Donald I'm going to turn this one so
yeah I apologize for that place quite difficult thing to film i've never
actually talked about properly before so hopefully it will help a lot of people
my last videos seem to have done so yeah that'll be good don't really know where
to start on this topic to be honest but i guess i will start with saying i had
suicidal thoughts throughout my depression not many times about four or
five times and there's there's thinking about it so the thought is problems
you're having that wall and then there's actually doing and they are there to
massively different things so if you are having them first of all don't panic
doesn't mean that you're going to do it is it's a natural
why of your mind just once this one something's happened and you have one
negative 20 after another and another know builds up in your mind guys are and
then they just the thought comes into your head you're not thinking it just
pops into your head
I i remember the tonight very clearly we're not have my Thornton attempt
shall we say and that's the one thing I will probably always remember which I'm
glad because it pushes me to never want to feel like that again and that's what
drives me to just continue improving improving my my own health so I'll tell
you my experience I don't hurt that by doing so you all help other people when
they will realize that they're not weirdos they're not going crazy just
because I've had these thoughts and feelings so in the thick of my
depression i dunno probably about seven months into it i was i have a day where
I just I couldn't feel anything and i forgot what happened as i forgot what
sadness was didn't I want to do anything I didn't want to go and see anyone talk
to anyone I just what I was just sitting there like a zombie throughout the my
depression my my mom has always was always just there for me so helpful and
and I felt some sort of comfort and just before about to go to bed
let's go to better look the next day I said to her mama don't know what to do i
I was in such a bad way and
and I didn't know I had nothing I hadn't been was no reason for me to live in my
mind I didn't I couldn't I couldn't work out what life was about because
everywhere when you think of life you think of all the wonderful things that
you want to do with your life or the feelings you get from seeing friends and
family and wanting to get job make money on a living
we're at whatever might be play sport up every good feeling I try to think I
couldn't get anything from it
I didn't feel anything i just didn't see the point of anything i I just I sets on
here so I don't know what to do I don't know how how I can go on and I remember
hugging my mom which normally gives me some sort of comfort and security but I
didn't feel anything and now and that to me was is the single worst thing in the
world where I didn't feel anything from hugging my mom and that point I just I
lost it and I i went into my room and i sat in the corner and some reason elson
their sisters in my or my wardrobe and I got the scissors and I just I put up to
my my neck and I was alright i just can't I can't do life animal and I was
gonna cut my dirt and I part of summers I couldn't cry but try and decide I
thought about I was there and I was trying that you didn't something stopped
me from doing and
like I said this you can bet he's thinking about it and is actually doing
and they're two completely different things so if you're if you think about
it and you have a thought with don't panic it's normal i don't have much
advice on how to stop the thoughts or or what to do when you're when you're
having them up see you need to you need to go and get help but that was the
point for me where I know I know I need proper help and i knew i knew that i
just had to check something had to change so i think i've said pretty much
all i can say on the subject I don't have much experience in it but but
hopefully what you've heard me talk about helped in some sort of way since
then the video i just say keep practicing positive thoughts keep doing
whatever makes you happy and don't let anyone stop you from being happy
