hey guys what's up it's done and this video is going to be trying to a
different video it's not going to happen enough fancy editing or anything
this is gonna be me and you guys talking and
I was gonna be I really know how to feel about this video
I've been wanting to make this video for a very long time probably
over a year now and I just been extremely nervous to make the video
because
I'm gonna be I'm this video just makes me feel really
I am NOT exactly and comfortable about talking about this topic but
it makes me feel and ignore that thing my
smoke alarm has been acting up lately so yeah it may bring of couple times in the
video
and I'm also sorry about the lighting it's 2am guy is on a Wednesday night
and there's no sign out so year's gonna have to deal with the Tigers
and if you guys don't wanna see this video or
a few people that are watching it right now just don't even want to hear about
what I'm going to be talking about
you cut out because this video is it for everybody it is for the people
by either are interested in hearing about
a story not really story but my past life
experiences pertaining to depression and self-harm index ID and all that
but you're also going through it and you want to hear
my overall thoughts about it
and
and just I just wanna help people you know
and I'm sorry if my sound a little bit
confused or lost the times is because I am
I'm I'm honestly and lost about this when it comes to this topic
but anyways i'm just still very
rollerball making this video discount on it goes back to a parade
but yet again I've been struggling with bullying and all that since I was maybe
kindergarten and first-grade you now long time ago
but things didn't really start affecting me until I got into middle school
are lot like I was bullied extremely hard but
when I got to middle school that's really wanna hit the things that are
said to people
affects everybody differently and some people can just shake it off but other
people depending on the state of mind that their and
they can they can make them I kill themselves and its its
it's terrible that we live in a society today but people are having to deal with
all these issues that
they don't ask for a mean nobody asked for issues but
nobody it there's not a reason to people leader to bully people there really
isn't
but back to what was going on with me I was good really hard a little about
summit great from like first grade
and when it really hit me like
milos the blows was eighth-grade I'm not that's only
in states that are like taxes but being gay doesn't
exactly come off as the past rap expecially when you're young and you're
confused
and if you're always hearing all these
people use gay ass like a bad word and there was a girl you're so gay
well %ah that it makes you feel like being gay is a terrible thing and I
would have rather
back in fifth grade I would have rather kill myself a national now and that's
when it
that's the honest the at all but passports like a trade I came out some
great summer everything was going good I was like yes fine everything's in the
lift off my shoulders
which a lot of things were a little off my shoulders everybody started leaving
me alone now it's great now that I was out a closet
but I had a lot of energy means that I was trying to fight
and there's a lot of stuff going on at home my parents were divorced in eighth
grade
I think they divorced in some great summer but there is a lot of stuff going
on
in eighth-grade that I couldn't handle her
and I was I was fighting a battle with myself
and I was losing and thats I guess
a lot of people issues but I don't really know how to explain it
if it hits home then I'm guessing you know how I feel when ever say I don't
know how to
they talk about it but I became extremely depressed like
extremely depressed I would I would come home from school every day and I would
just
lock myself in my room from right when I got home from school all the way to the
next day I wake up no go to school or not say anything to people I go home
do that same thing I just locked myself in my room and I would sleep
all day and I'd step all night long I had terrible insomnia
but I would do diet along with
you know I just isolated myself from everything because I just didn't want to
deal with and whenever I would sleep
I just gonna have to deal with the life I had to I guess live and you know I'm
in
and sleeping I don't know I'm just I would just force myself to sleep because
when your sleep it's kinda like a world away from a world
in a way and I would start myself for like
days at a time and I'll come to school and I would like I her one time I was in
my English class
and I literally felt like I was discussed house out right there because
I had it even so long
and my weight was dropping I I don't notice the bottom eatings
there are so many things like insomnia
just anxiety depression and self-harm all the stuff in it
they all hit me out once and I just felt like my world was
ending Lake I just trying to find anything I could possibly find
just take the pain away if that makes sense
I waited I would get high everyday like
every single day I would get high just I would smoke and I do
all this stuff just to make the pain go away when reality I should have just
been
fixing my issues like straight on without any substance as
nothing
I started smoking cigarettes I started smoking weed which wasn't it's not a bad
thing
but if you're an enterprise data mind and you do it
every day just so that you don't have to fill reality then that is a bad thing
and a lot of people to understand why people
cut or scratch or hit themselves or anything along the lines are just self
harm in general
but guys whenever you do that I know this for me is that whenever I started
to harm
it first on my wrestlers like who I don't like this
so that I went on smilax and not work I really bad like
but really really bad and it was especially on
the sly great here but it was like oh my thighs and nobody could really see but
I would cut sold I'd like might let you can even see
the lines at the cuts that's how bad it was and I would come to school and I
couldn't walk upstairs
all the stuff and I was addicted to feeling nothing and that's the truth at
all because
whenever I would cut myself it would just I felt nothing I literally just
made my whole body now and I would just
film nothing and it was like a way of releasing
everything inside the just made me so depressed that everything in
it's addicting guys like if you haven't started it
and if you are depressed and you've been thinking about it don't start because it
is so addicting guys
I swear to God is like it is like heroin like it really is like heroin to a drug
addict because
we start you can't stop its like every day it's on your mind
all the time nobody knew like I mean yeah
my parents knew that I was depressed and they were making me correctly therapy
for
every week I think it was on a Tuesday every week on Tuesday I'll go to therapy
and
I never told my therapist I would
self-harm and I never told my mom on my sister anything I was like whatever
I'll just tell them everything else like a pastor everything
except the harm in that was probably like the biggest
thing II said I guess talked about the hurty so badly to see people
who are going through these things so they don't have anybody to go to
to I mean nobody I have friends who will just will be sold side and
no one realizes that like I was so that covering it up I mean yeah I like I
would just alternative analysis carry
scary music so yeah I guess I kind of like
said yeah he's depressed or whatever but there's so many things
under the surface guys I swear my camera hates me this is the second time it's
messed up on me
just following this video but back to what i'm saying is that
if you're going to something you need help
talk to me guys you anybody I don't care who you are
you can be too young to be all I don't care if you're going through something
and you need somebody to talk to you
talk to me you can candy me on instagram you can talk its water tumbler
anything guys Eisler I will always be there for
anybody who needs help because I've been through similar things I didn't have
people
I had maybe like a couple friends but they did it know what I was feeling you
know i mean they just
like people are lucky I'm here for you but in reality they can't relate to you
don't know what you're going through and I know what you're going through I
understand
you can talk to me if you don't want to talk to you can to anonymously I don't
care but
just get help if you're going for something and you need someone to help
to speak out about it don't keep inside until something really bad happens
because
you I know that if you're depressed
any feel like you don't wanna live
that not letting will take everything away
but re Ali comes and attract
there so much to live for and they're so much to experience that
aid in your life at some point for either
bullying you're just being really depressing anything is it worth it
getting hope is really scary eyes
it's extremely scary I remember how nervous I was the first time I went to
that their
stop is and the first time ever heard speaking out about it cuz
my parents would be like my mom crying meet I'm just open up to her and tell
her what was wrong
and that was so scary just two
feel voter book is nobody wants a below-normal but
in this circumstance that's kinda the only feeling you will be filling
but in the long run it helps so much just
please get home don't don't pick up that late don't pick up that razor don't pick
up
anything because there's so much more
to get from like I know
home this is really confusing topic to just I guess speak about a minute to win
this video
I don't know but I guess what and trying to get from this video
is to let people know that
no matter how worthless you're feeling you're worth
everything no matter how down years you're feeling and no matter how
depressed you are
and the
nobody should have to go through
being bullied are anything that makes them feel terrible inside
if someone's making you fill Lake you're working nothing
nobody should have to go through that and its
it's terrible that we live in a place to wear people do that to each other
and spine somebody that you can talk to you and
just don't please do not
in your life there's so much to live for
and you're worth everything to me I mean I may not know you you may not know me
but everybody matters no matter what
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what gender you are to the matter what race
you are as a matter
you're worth something and
everybody sorry
my video that I was recording shut off I
didn't really know what to say I was kinda but a loss for words
and it's like two days later now I'm editing it right now
and I didn't want to end on such a sound depressing note
so I just wonder mind you all that whenever I have 400 subscribers I will
be doing a 402 cyber
giveaway and we are almost there so keep it up everybody I hope you guys like
the video and I will see all next week by guys
hmm the brawls
