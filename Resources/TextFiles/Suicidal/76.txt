ok ok ok ok i'm so tired and just so tired i feel like i've been away for
four days and i don't feel like i'm here i feel like i'm drunk like I've had
three wines and shots and beer and i'm tired and ready to go home and I can't
talk to anyone because I've forgotten how I usually talk
I don't even look like me everything is so wrong and weird and scary
honestly think I'm going mad I can't stop crying I've got such a bad headache
and I've just constantly felt like drunk and blind you know when you're hammered
and everything is really bright and you can't remember how to talk properly
you're not really taking anything in because you feel really weird and you
can touch things and see things and talk to people but you're not really there
I genuinely genuinely think I've gone mad and I don't know whether I'm going
to see things like normal again here's the thing i'm alive i can breathe
I can eat and talk and sleep and see and feel so I should be okay and objectively
I am fine
so why am I not it's one of those things that I keep thinking about over and over
to the point where my head is like is this really happening and then I'm like
is what really happened I used to not understand mental illnesses at all i was
like just think of cats and rainbows but now I get it
it's so much deep in your brain cats and rainbows I used to say if I ever got
dementia or something I'd fight it but how can you fight it
when the it is the thing we are using to fight with cody has gone full blown mad
ok now i have to actually talk have written a script but I think I'm gonna I
think I'm going to put the script in the description and then i'm just going to
use it to bounce ideas off of and just talk just talk
ok yeah yeah yeahs mental illness isn't pretty and it's not easy or simple you
can't like put your finger on it is different and personal and ugly
it's not all that's all blowing our thumbs to come back
panic attacks and it's not some cute cartoon girl sitting in a corner
and crying it's so much more complex and not nice and gross and weird and the
strange and wrong
I didn't have that haven't been making videos because I didn't know how to
when my head has just been consumed by this you may so you may have seen on 20
may have seen on twitter or face
so you may help so that you may have seen on twitter by posted that I've felt
really weird and mental illness just isn't very good and i was going to take
a little break from the internet i mentioned this in my VidCon video I said
that haven't really felt like I'm here since I was 17 years old and then within
the last week that feeling sort of <month> May </month> i about eighty
percent i went to Wales for some shoots and then I just felt crazy the whole
weekend and I came back
thinking I would feel better i slept more thinking I feel better i kept
thinking that I just wake up and feel better and I didn't got very panicky
about the fact that i was going mad because I just
I'm seeing things very differently I know I sound insane
I feel like I am insane as soon as i realized i forgot how to talk to my
house me
I decided I should register for a doctor and I was like yes I will do that
so I walked all the way to the doctor with the proof of address but they said
that you need proof of address from the last two months and try not to cry but I
walked home in this weird bright dream world spinning just so strange trying to
find an address and then my mom called and said what's going on
he ok because i was missing her a lot and then it just sort of burst into
tears just kind of broke
whilst rummaging through Ben's trying to find my dress was a sorry sight
I thought it would be good if I visited my home my family home because I thought
it would be good because I felt normal there and I wanted to feel normal and
feel something familiar except my home my family home is a little bit damaged
at the moment so of course nothing is familiar
everything's a bit different everything is a lot different because you can't go
back in time
I got very upset about the fact that I
- my old bed in Dovan flat I just wanted to take all those her crying just on
your makeup
I just want that come on say it
i I just wanted to get into my old bed in my old room and feel normal again
download the thing is when mmm since the thing is when I'm visiting my old home
I'm not visiting 2012 I'm just visiting that house that I used to live in but
its twenty sixteen going to anyone and I feel different now
I don't think this made anything better but I even visit my old primary school
which has been like broken down like it's all environments now on they're
trying to sell it whatever I probably shouldn't have gone and I think I'm not
really allowed but me and how do you have a little look around and it was so
we don't think it helped i just had an eye for it - is stuck in the past here
it was like crazy familiar except everything is now overgrown and brew and
it was sort of like that happened in seconds and it was just very strange ya
didn't help i don't think i don't know why i mentioning it
oh no now thank you to the comments on my last video and Google
I think I figured out what this is am I feel so weird and I think it's a big old
mixture of depression anxiety and depersonalization I think that's the
main thing just know that when I found articles about it and pages about it I
was so thankful that there was something there to describe what I was feeling I
promise you that I'm not like looking for it i'm not reading symptoms and
making it fit with how I feel so i can put into it honestly why would I do that
why would I want to feel this way it's very easy to do that and it's dangerous
to do that don't do that anyway I'm gonna get myself some nice therapy
good ol dr. and try and sort this out but for now I have a plan
just quickly before i get into my plan I know what you're thinking you're
thinking dirty
especially if you've never dealt with any kind of mental illness at all
you're probably thinking dirty just turn it off like just shut up just stop
talking about it stop obsessing over attention-seeking you're making this up
and you're making yourself believe that you're in
personally I'm so happy that you can feel that way because that means that
you can't relate to this
so go and enjoy your life and feel the world people
I feel like you're living in a different world - I am I feel like I've all living
in a different world - why am I keep seeing everyone as humans and i am a
robot
everyone's gonna think I'm hi everyone is going to think I'm on drugs and not
on drugs or program basically I can't I don't know what I've done I think I've
dug myself i think i have obsessed over it to the point where I've got myself in
a little groove in my brain and I can't figure out how to get out of it by
myself
depression and anxiety and all of these sorts of nice mental illnesses are like
obsessions their sets of disorders where you think about something so much it
just varies in your brain and consumes your brain so
okay here's my plan my plan is I'm going to act normal
I can still sing I'm alive on this planet even though i don't feel like i
am so finding this funny
I can still taste you can tell my jokes i can write songs and hang out with
friends and do all of the things that make me happy as happy as I can be for
someone who doesn't really feel like it here and whilst doing that on the side i
will find a cure and I will sort myself
I'm going to do everything normal that i can i'm going to try my bloody best
that's what i'm going to do today i woke up at nine after a good seven hours
sleep
I went for a run in the Sun I made myself breakfast I did someone i did
some meditation and I'm making a video and after this video is done we're going
to visit my old school friends and have a drink and alongside all of that i'm
going to find a doctor and I'm going to find a therapist and I will work on my
brain and all my head cause it's gotten to the point where I can't deal with
this by myself and I shouldn't have really let it get that . but I've just
been pushing it aside
top tip don't do that if you feel like there's something wrong please go seek
help
as soon as you can I went to the doctor when i was 17 and I tried to describe
what I was feeling but she just said i was making out and that really put me
off for so long because I thought that I was making it up and my problems were
insignificant your problems are not insignificant if you know that there's
something wrong with you or if you feel like there's something wrong with you go
to a doctor and do not stop going to the doctor until they help you it's so much
better to catch whatever it is early in the bud
nope nip it in the bud early in the you know what I mean
whether it's panic attacks or depression or anxiety even like the smallest amount
that you're feeling a bit down
therapy is good for you meditation is very good for you don't just keep
suppressing and suppressing it hoping it will go away because it will probably
manifest itself into something worse
I'm going to do the best I can i'm going to make all of the videos that make me
happy and I'm going to laugh at the fact that i'm a bit mental
because there's not really much else you can do and it is a bit funny
I do sound crazy I'm going to leave some links in the description
- what I'm feeling and I'm going to leave links to some help from website
and let's have a chat
if I have scared you away by being very strange
I'm sorry not just going to lie and say that I am 10 out in okay because I'm not
no one is how are you feeling it strange now want to meet friends and like how
you and they're like I'm fine and I'm like how are you fine i don't really
know what else to say
oh and that ok let's see I think I'm going to try my best to still do veg
but i'm going to miss some days and that's okay i think now
ok I think rather than doing veg I'm just going to make as many videos as I
can and as I want to because making videos does make me happy
ok we're right all right okay all right
