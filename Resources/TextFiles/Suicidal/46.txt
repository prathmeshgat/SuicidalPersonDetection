hello so this is going to be a very different kind of video but i just
wanted to kind of put it out there
this is my my
like I don't know what I'm going to name this video yet but I'm just mainly
talking about like my struggles that I've overcome for the past few years
like when I was like a little so I promise I'll try not to make it super
duper long but i just wanted to kind of put this out i want any sympathy from
anyone i'm just kind of telling my story because it helps me talk about the
things that I've gone through and maybe it'll help me to improve a little bit
more in my life
and as I keep growing so yeah um I'm just going to start off by saying that i
was diagnosed last year my junior high school with clinical depression and
severe anxiety disorder when I was in elementary school about fourth grade I
was bullied a lot and I wasn't the most attractive young little person ever but
like I had super long hair glasses I had braces like the whole shebang
and yeah I so I got picked on a lot and it really took a lot out of the out of
me i never told never told anyone and I'm not going to mention any names or
anything in this video just because i don't i don't want to bash anyone
I feel like it's very immature thing to do but someone who was very extremely
close to me would also pick on me as well and proud of her friends but when
we were together she would act like she was like my best friend and we're super
close but in front of everyone else I was just something to make fun of
so I pretty much grew up with that in my life I never believed that I was any
kind of beautiful or pretty or anything like that
inside and out I never believed in myself at all i just stick with my
studies and that's how human made myself feel better was getting good grades
because that's pretty much i felt like i had and i just want to see I never had a
terrible childhood childhood at all
my parents were amazing parents to me we did so many fun things together as a
family
I never really had any bad things happen to me when I was little
so that's why I kind of feel like unappreciative of my life because I
didn't have to go through a lot of other things that a lot of people have had to
go through but anyways when I was in sixth grade I got my braces removed
I got contacts and sixth grade and I cut my hair
I didn't come here to talk about it really make a difference eight they saw
an ugly person on the outside that's what I saw as well so it came to the
point where I just felt like there was nothing I can do to make to please
anyone to make anyone feel - like me
really so its sixth grade is when i made my first suicide of tent
I was in my bedroom sitting on the floor and my sister and her friend over and
they're playing loud music so they wouldn't hear me if anything happened
and I had a screwdriver in my hand and I was prepared to stop myself pretty much
an art but at the very lucky last second
and I fell on my hands and I started bawling and my sister came in and just
saw me crying on the floor but she didn't happen so it
nothing really occurred to her and after that since the sixth grade I began to
cut myself
I did it in a very secret places I never cut myself on my wrists
I would do it like on my legs like on my thighs
so it was never visible and yeah that was pretty much my childhood seventh and
eighth grade I i had seemed to get more of a confidence in me
I cut my hair like I tried I started wearing makeup
I tried to started altering myself to make myself look like like a normal
pretty popular girl pretty much and I kind of fell into that hole popularity
scheme of things I get started
not hanging out with friends that I had when I was younger and hanging out with
something like the cooler popular kids kids and I got close to them so
and looking back on it it's the whole popularity thing is so overrated and
stupid because after you get out of school especially in high school after
you get out of high school
Nolan cares no one absolutely carries it what you did in high school
it's and that's just it so I'm going back
looking back on my life now lies you get caught up and all these materialistic
things and it's hard not to
honestly like when it's all around you and you don't know you're doing it
either you just kind of okay like going with the flow of things which isn't bad
at all
but looking back on it I wish I would have stayed more to myself but then
again I didn't want to alter myself because I didn't feel pretty
I never thought once that I was pretty or worthy of anything
worthy of life really so that steadily increased over the course of junior high
all throughout high school and i'm not going to go into any details about my
life but and I was starting to seem like a very big explanation of things but I
don't want people's names to get brought up I don't want to watch them over and
then obviously because they still is very mature but a lot of things boys
friendships a lot of things started happening to me that I just I didn't
know how to handle
I didn't know how to handle on stresses and how to handle juggling homework
boyfriends friends all of that stuff so I started putting off a lot of my school
work that I had before
always been about always in my homework but that's all I had and now i would put
it aside because I'd rather go and hang out and do other things like everything
like that so my grades dropped quite a bit
I would barely passed like English and just I didn't have motivation to do
anything i would just come home from school sit and stare at a blank wall and
do nothing
i I didn't want to do anything no homework i thought i could do it when
the bell ring I go into class and I try to do it real quick
but if I didn't turn in my homework I didn't care at all so I felt somewhat
like a zombie
pretty much just going throughout life doing nothing pretty much not caring
about anything and my sophomore year in may of my sophomore year
my
grandmother had passed away and me and her were super close she lived right
across the street for me so and it
it was hard on me because I didn't know that she was sick she had had a breast
cancer alone like a long time ago and she had beat it
so everything is perfect to be supportive for so much for it but this
last time the breast cancer cells actually came back and they had went
down to her liver and so one night she just she went to the bathroom and her
liver just exploded
so my papa found her in the bathroom and you have the talk i know and yeah I
blamed
looking back on it I had blame to my parents for so long because it because I
i didn't know that she was sick or else I would have made more of an effort to
hug her longer and you know to spend time with her and the the week that she
had passed my uncle was getting married and she had passed away two days before
he was to get married so it was a really hard time for our family
yeah sorry I promised myself I wouldn't cry
yeah and the time that she had passed me and I was actually taking my finals for
a school and I had to get pulled out of class and I didn't return for the rest
of finals so and i didn't i didn't care at all about
test and i had AP tests as well and i had to do the head to the makeup finals
and then the makeup appt
just but I didn't want to do it at all
I was I wasn't even focused it's the last thing that I wanted on my mind
and so yeah that was a sophomore year and then throughout
oh sorry I'm very very fidgety dates the anxiety partner
so my junior year like I said before I don't know how to deal with things and
they come up and I hold a lot of things in so leading up to this has been years
and years and years of things that have happened in my life and I've always just
held it in
so my junior I've had I had a lot a lot of things that happened i was in a very
abusive relationship
mentally and psychologically psychologically and that just absolutely
tore me apart
yeah it was i felt i push all my friends away i didn't i barely talk to them and
I was just alone and I stayed because I didn't have anyone else and no one else
I could talk to one day I'm going to write a book and I'll explain it all
these details but right now I just don't want to bore you guys don't like the
little details but
no I I I was so alone and so caught up
and what was going on in the world and blaming blending everything I could
why is this happening to me why me why me all right good thing supposed to
happen to good people i felt like i was a good a good person
I had a lot of morals and things that a lot of people didn't have and I just
just blame everything
why why is this happening to me and it was my best friend's birthday party
it's over spring break and i was i just i hit my breaking point and i got really
drunk and his first time ever drink in my life
your first time I drank like excessively and I don't remember half the things
that happen and people still today make fun of me and joke around with me about
it and I know they're just joking and I don't blame them for that but it it just
brings back so many bad things that happened to me that led up to that point
so that it just I just want went wild and crazy and after that my world around
me just completely switched
I this was a Saturday and by monday i was on my knees begging to God that
people would forget about it and they didn't and I felt like no one absolutely
no one was there for me
no one carry that I that happened to me and they knew that it was a really tough
time for me and all that
I heard so
much so much stuff around school and people would come up to me and tell me
stories that things have been going to do you remember this and I would just be
like no I'm sorry I don't remember and i was in my last period of the day and I
just started just I just broke down started bawling and at the same time
well I was going out with I wasn't together with him up time but he was
just use trying to take advantage of me basically
while all this was happening he would send me text messages cussing me out and
asking me to send him pictures naked pictures just pretty much trying to take
advantage of me he said if I would send these pictures and then he would forgive
me about getting drunk at the party and this was all in my last period
and at that very moment I decided you know what I I can't do this anymore
I don't want to be here anymore so I drove off school I went to the cemetery
because I loved like literally like a street over from the cemetery it's like
pretty much my backyard and I went and visited my grandma and I doctor for a
little bit and i just made my decision
so i went home and i sat on the couch and I had a glass of water and I have a
bottle full of pills and this person kept texting me asking to send pictures
so i took a picture of the medicine bottle and ascended to when I sit here
you go
and I have tried to do it to make attempts before but I never went through
with it
I just said I did I don't want to be here anymore and I've held
I always kept the bottle close to me always looked at
at it but i would just break down and I want to do it so I sent him the picture
and he said you won't do it
you want to do it and he's like you're just use doing this for attention and
you want to it and I said okay I'm gonna prove you wrong
so I sat down on the couch and just kept taking pills
i stopped counting after 32 increments of three and four and five and i would
just stopped counting after that and i took the last the last handful and I
said okay this should be good
i'm gonna go i'm gonna take it out and I'm not gonna wake up so they don't
couch and take it out and about three hours later
um I woke up unfortunately and I went to the bathroom and I threw up man got so
sick
um so yeah my camera lights and I have the remember where I was and um anyways
my mom just kind of came in and some blamed me throwing up for a great for
our eating but I just told her you know this was because i tried to kill myself
so from there the next day I went to her work which she works at high school and
I talked to the psychologist there who is actually one of our close friends and
I told her just the gist of everything that was going on
and she said I needed to go to the nurse right away in which there is called
poison control to make sure everything was ok from me taking all those pills
and she said . could poison control said that I needed to go to the hospital
immediately
so I went to the emergency room and the psychologist the family friend told me
when you go
you need to tell them exactly what happened
so I went to the hospital and pretty much just they asked what happened I
said I i took a lot of pills and they asked why and I said Lucetta tent and
they said okay so i had to take a year and test mobile lettuce and they said my
kidneys were a little bit damaged because of the pills but it's nothing
too serious and from there i just had to sit in the hospital bed and my mom from
there my mom just calling everyone family like my best friend's mom telling
them what happened and yeah I just I was just kind of sitting there I thought oh
I wasn't gonna be there like long at all but i just kinda there like just kind of
taking everything that happened I am I wasn't like necessary excited that I was
there but I was glad that i was because I had finally got in the help that I so
desperately desperately needed and wanted so I felt safe and I felt
comfortable knowing that I was going to get help and from there they looked at
different hospitals to transfer me to and
at about 4i went into hospital around 10 may be there in ten eleven in the
morning and buy for the pick me up in an ambulance and took me to a mental
institution where I was placed on a mandatory three-day-old which means i
just have to have to say their mentor for three days and the best way to
describe it was prison
pretty much all the windows were barred up they had like double room of security
so you had to go through one room to get to the next room to get to the place
where we were and I was with a bunch of other kids that were my age some younger
the youngest girl i was there was five years old and she was in there for the
abusive her mother
there's three reasons why you are placed in there
one was harming yourself one was harming others and the other was the inability
to take care of yourself
so I was just looking around all these these kids and I would hear their
stories and they grew up so terribly
terrible things happen to them they some little streets
some didn't have parents are a bigger at their grandparents some were abused by
their parents and I'm just sitting here like I have an amazing life going there
made me appreciate my life so much more so much more than I could ever imagine
and I just I couldn't have anything on me all I have with the clothes that I
went to the hospital with I didn't even have
shoes because my shoes had shoelaces and I don't allow shoelaces
so I had a shirt pants and I had does it go ahead and I was there for three days
oh I went in on tuesday and i wasn't released until saturday so I was held
for wednesday thursday friday and it was it was a crazy experience to say the
least
there's really nothing else I can really say about it
their kids and their kids
I was 16 when I was in there 17 of 17 knows
15 16 of 16 when i was there and you there is an hour and a half
visiting the station . so i went in at about 4 430 5 presentation was in until
six-thirty
so my mom went home and packed a bunch of stuff for me and brought it back to
me and i had had a few magazines ahead
I had a blanket and a few extra clothes and that's all i have with me you
weren't allowed to have pencils in your room
you aren't allowed to have makeup hair brushes are you could have was except
for showering and that was pretty much it it it it was a prison
it really was a prison
I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world though i'm so happy that i
went and had to go through that experience that my roommate
she taught me a lot she was in there because she also tried to kill herself
um and she was fourteen 14 years old and she was in there
she also she was scared a lot she woke up a lot during the night she never
showered and it sounds gross but her dad used to last her in the shower
that's why she didn't shower and I loved her like a little sister she meant a lot
to me and she taught me a lot of things she said one thing to me
we're in a call at school every hour so like five six seven every hour we would
go into this room with every they're all the patients and we have school pretty
much we did sometimes we would color
one day they brought pets and we had pet therapy and we're sitting there in class
and the teacher was just going around asking us questions and she as she leans
over you were sitting next to each other she leans over and she says are you
gonna say something and I said no not know I don't really shy
I want to say anything and she was like I am too but i think if it if i said i
have exactly what she said but she said if I feel like it's going to help
someone then I'll say something and i'll speak up and that that's what I carry
this is this is two years later a year later
and I still every day
think about that and I think about her and if anyone asked me what my biggest
you got regret in life was she'd give me your email on the day that I was
released and then she put it in my little by little paper bags that we kept
our stuff in and she put it in there for me to email her it if she had ever was
going through anything that you want to talk to me like a contact her and I get
home and I can't find the base before anywhere lost and never found it and I
think about her every day wondering if she's alive she's doing up here but um
anyway I was released on saturday and that day I was I went prom dress
shopping
this was in April this is april 12 or 13
they brought their teeth 12 able to UM and I would probably shopping because
problem is the next month and it was different
I saw saw everything in a different light and I appreciate it so much and
i'm really glad that it went through and I wouldn't change it for anything else
and so after I was released from the hospital
I had to go seek therapy so I was on there be for about six clones before she
said I didn't come anymore
you go
I don't go to therapy more I'm still on my antidepressant medication and for
anxiety as well i'm not going to say that I'm cured because i don't think
anyone who's ever gone through something like this is ever cured
some days are easier than others definitely but you just have to always
focus on the positives and never had the negatives in life because that's what i
did i focused on all the bad things that have ever happened to me and that's what
much took took my life away to say the least
I do struggle a lot a lot still
but honestly I'm so thankful that I'm out of high school and the sense that
it's a fresh start for me
school is really where everything started the bad things that happen to me
started so being away from all that it's really helped me and now i just kind of
them
I do things that I love to do i I just got a new job
I'm so excited about and I hang out with my friends more a boyfriend now
who loves me so much and I'm so thankful that i have in my life and that i have
all my friends who supported me through everything in my life and I'm ungrateful
of the life that I do have and.yeah I just going to take things day by day now
and it is hard at times I take things you know
one step at a time and yeah i'm just i'm going to continue to be you stronger
person but I feel like this is really going to help me in the sense that it
makes me feel better knowing that other people can understand my story
like I said before I don't want
sympathy from anyone I just want people to know I know where I come from know
what I've been through so that they understand and that's what I look at now
I this is why I pretty much i wanted to start my channel
um I wanted to see things through beauty because I've never seen anything through
BTW before I want to express how important it is to feel beautiful not
just look beautiful but feel actually feel how beautiful at each and every
person is and that's what really it helps it helps me because I want to
think that same way as well so maybe if I portrait on to others that will help
me realize the same thing and yeah I that's that's just my main goal here on
my channel to promote you know beauty and self-worth and confidence and I try
to look I try to see everything now in a different light like if I see a girl
walking down the street and she has purple pants and blue hair and some
people would be like oh what you think she was really showing purple pants and
she's blue hair now i think weíll like maybe those are her favorite pair of
pants and she loves the color blue so she wanted to dye your hair blue
like do whatever makes you feel beautiful and who cares who FB cares
about what other people think and say about you
no one no one cares and that's just that's all . of me putting my story out
to you and some people who is if some people are going through the same things
that I went through and that i'm still going through
maybe you can see this and you can relate to me and know that you are not
alone
in any way possible you are not alone in this world
it opened my eyes to see how many people are truly going to these things every
single day and just know any struggle that you have you can always confide in
someone and do and know that you are not alone in any way and me even if you want
to text me or email me or do something and you want just to talk to someone
about things that you might not feel comfortable talking to other people
about because they have never gone through before that would make me like
so happy and inside and that's just one thing I want to just tell everyone you
are not alone
you are all beautiful and any struggle that you've gone through some people
might say you know like you have it a lot of people have it way worse than you
in this world and yeah a lot of you will do have it way worse than us in this
world but that doesn't take away the bad things that have happened to us that
doesn't justify anything that's happened to us
just because someone else has had it worse doesn't mean your situation is any
less than their situation
everyone is unique everyone has their own story and this is my story so i hope
you guys enjoyed it i'm sorry if i'm ranting on and on and on but this is
what's important to me and i think that if i put it out there someone else might
feel things the same way as me and know that again they are not alone
and yeah I'm gonna stop talking now because I'm well talked out but thank
you so so much for watching this it really means so much to me
you guys have no idea this this whole channel and all of you guys who just
watched my videos

I'm sorry I've been like am ia I like I said I I got a new job now and i'm
registering for school and I had like all these things but i am going to try
