green my friend Monique here thank you for joining me today so I wanted to talk
about how I overcame suicide and the reason I like to share my story about
this is because I think it will resonate with a lot of people who have gone
through something like that or maybe just gone through periods of feeling
blue and sad and I think it'll also resonate with people who maybe have a
live within their life who is going through this has got to do this in the
past
a little bit of backstory I'm gonna give you guys the backstory and then you know
things that I've found led me to be susceptible to depression and to be
actively suicidal and then what I've done actively since then to pull myself
out of that and to live a life where I feel like driving emotionally a little
bit of backstory ten years ago when I was in my early twenties I was severely
depressed as severely depressed about 18 20 21 or so and I became actively
suicidal whatever is 21 I'm 31 now so it's been a total of a tenuous and
something that I felt you know what happened at the time when I actually
tried to follow through with my suicide plan is I feel like life intervened eyad
kind of made it impossible for me to succeed in my suicide plan and in a lot
of ways that was the biggest blessing I feel like that's what gave me a second
chance to live this life with the purpose and determination that I do now
in my everyday so what are some of the things that led me to feeling more
depressed in my early twenties about time I think the biggest thing is that I
had no sense of self-love I that concept wasn't even in my awareness at that time
and in fact I actually had a lot of dealing with self-loathing and
self-hatred and just low self esteem in general
I always felt like I wasn't good enough at that time like I wasn't meeting the
expectation that I should be meeting and that I was basically just bailing out by
if that's really how I felt at that time I was a big people pleaser that was not
what is what I function under I was so focused on pleasing the people around me
on doing what they wanted me to do it even if that meant but trained who I
naturally was in a lot of ways they had no sense of who I naturally was but
everything that I did that felt not true to me or that the league I was just
doing it out of obligation or out of fear was really funny actively betrayed
myself and I was doing that hundreds of times over the years 10 years ago when I
was in my early twenties I was trying to meet the expectations of other people
and it brings up this quote from Einstein that says you know if you judge
a fish by how well it climbs a tree its gonna grow up its whole life believing
it's stupid and I remember when I first read that quote very much resonated with
how I felt during that period in my life I felt like I was a fish trying to climb
a tree rather than realizing that I was a fish and I was really good at swimming
and could be a damn good summer if you're really good about my capability
instead of even recognizing that I was just so focused on climbing a tree
because that's what I thought everybody wanted me to be doing and inevitably
just felt so bad about myself and belly and really wasn't good at weather is
good at meeting those expectations of other people so I just felt like I was
feeling really something else that was a deep feeling that I was having
especially at the time when I became actively solicit all I had this deep
feeling that I was a burden on others that my existence was a burden on the
people that I love and I actually believed that if I ended my life I would
be lifting this burden off of that my feelings they would live a happier more
peaceful life without me in it and that I am preventing them from being that way
because of my depression
so you know that was something that I i I felt very deeply at that time I also
felt like you know like the air that I was breathing was a waste of air you
know that has to do with being so self loathing and self-hate or is that I it
inevitably lead to feelings of me you know feeling like some other organism
would be better off reading there that I'm breathing so those are some of the
tens emotions I was going out also wasn't allied with my heart by any means
I had no sense of my true self of my soul of my heart
calling I had no said that and when I did feel an inkling of that I was too
afraid to follow it you know my life was dictated by fear at that point so what
pulled me out of the depression there are many things
actively began doing up a time and still actively engage and in order to keep
myself in a healthy place one of those is that I stopped I thought there and
what he did for me what getting counseling does for most people is that
it puts you in a space where there's somebody there you can share your story
with you can share the deepest target darkest parts of yourself in that person
will validate what your experience and will be able to taking that information
in a non-judgmental unconditionally accepted way in all of that create a
safe space for you and for a lot of people were feeling severely depressed
and her family very suicidal they don't have that XP haven't had that experience
with another human being where they feel fully seam where they feel
non-judgmental he accepted and counselors are trained specifically in
providing that within that in and of itself is an incredibly healing
experience so that kind of set me on the road to four for the first time in my
life a tuning to myself i'd be the first of all my life going through therapy you
know it's so interesting because I was only there be consistently for three
months I was seeing a counselor every weekend I went from being depressing
actively suicidal to living a life or at experience joy and euphoria
and bliss and peace for the first time in my life just in a three-month period
without any medication so that tells you how powerful it is to a tune to yourself
to be in a place where you can learn to add to your cell and then to cultivate
self-love so from that experience I began to cultivate self-love I began to
start kind of actively putting and thought that I love myself that I'm
worried the these books by Louise Hay found me and I'm gonna put her name in
the resources below along with some of the books that I really enjoyed by her
and she is a very large practitioner of affirmation and of cultivating self-love
so I learned how to do mera work from one of the books I read from her which
is basically you look in the mirror and you tell yourself I love you I really
love you you know maybe even look in the mirror and say ahh permission from the
Mira do that also and that helped me to develop a healthier more centered more
loving relationship with myself so it was you know counseling kind of started
me on that path and then I began to actively cultivated myself by practicing
my own sense of self love reading books from louise hay also another book that I
love is a book from Indiana more John he called dying to be me and I'll put that
the resources below and basically the essence of that book is to realize I
just because we exist we are worried about love nobody has to do anything to
be worthy of love your existence of I thought you were born makes you
inevitably worthy of love that was a very powerful book and centering me and
my own sense of self-love as well something else that I actively practiced
in myself that I did not do before when I was very depressed with or something
else that I actively practiced out that pulled me out of the depression from
that time is that I practice my own sense of kindness my own compassion
towards myself in nine judgmental accepted so for example you know I still
experience you know moment our ups and downs you know where I have made me sad
lured apprised those moments don't stick in there not
nearly as they're not nearly as painful as they were in my early twenties that
is I have more grounded and centered this now but the way that I think about
it is you know if you're if you're sending in the ocean
you know if I'm sitting in the ocean and my feet are kind of securely in the sand
and my head above the water
our emotions are kind of like the way that goes through the ocean and
sometimes those waves they're very small and sometimes they're very big and
ultimately it's not about avoiding the wave or getting rid of the wave I think
it's just about grounding ourself and centering ourselves and more where we're
standing so that when the wave comes in hits that we don't get completely
knocked off killed though for example if I'm going through a period where I am
feeling more sad I'll just focus
practice things that make me feel more grounded like practicing gratitude like
practicing self-love and those things actually help me deep in my feet into
the earth and become more centered in myself as I'm getting hit by those ways
I also popped his kindness and compassion so I left my I tell myself
that it's ok I'm feeling this way I it's ok I'm feeling blue I still love myself
anyways and I know that that doing so that's something that I actively
practiced as well and other thing is that I live my life and plan my life
according to my heart
according to my joy according to what makes me feel peaceful and that is
something that I feel I have a chance in life to actually do that you know when I
was depressed and suicidal having that experience of life intervening and may
not be able to follow through with my suicide plan I feel like I was given a
check
second chance to live this life and if I'm going to choose to live this life I
have to choose it for adding to my joy because when I didn't do that according
to my joy I felt so depressed and life didn't deal worth living
so if I'm going to make life worth living it has to be centered around
a piece and my joy in my heart's desire so that is what I actively structure my
life around I follow my joy and I follow it feels good
expansive and liberating in my heart and that honestly is what helped me to feel
the most blissful peaceful joyful times in my life I think I'm driving now
because that's something I actively cultivate and honestly for me the
depression and suicidality 10 years ago was my biggest teacher because I think
for a lot of people when they're feeling depressed or suicidal life is trying to
tell you something like this trying to tell you there's something going and
you're on your life it's not working and you need to let it go so that you can
create a space for your best left-hander that absolutely is what life was trying
to tell me at that time and I am so I feel like it was the biggest blessing in
the biggest teacher for me because now I know when I leave my kind of
restructuring my Pathan started the new path after I pulled myself out of the
depression you know I started following what the right to die hard and sometimes
very aligned with us and make a left and follow a path that I thought was the
right to my heart but then it didn't you know about constructing and it felt like
my body tightened up it felt the opposite of liberating and the wonderful
thing is I took that as a sign I go I must have been following my heart
there's something this is more like intense me to be in the great thing is
that you can turn back onto the past the book feels good to you and life will
just follow that immediately you can go back to feeling good feeling peaceful
and your heart and so for me it's definitely a journey but it's a constant
attuned to what feels right in my heart and planning my life around that I
noticed that when I do that I am able to fill my cup so much that is overflowing
and when I can present myself to the people that I love to my family my
friends with an overflowing cut not only do I feel like I'm it would have a more
genuine authentic transparent relationship with them but they actually
feel that love so much more strongly it's a saturated love that I can provide
because I'm giving it first so
