hi guys my name is Angelica cat and today I want to talk about self-harm and
suicide
I know that if you've watched on the internet video you would notice that i
did already make a self-harm and suicide video but I didn't really go into depth
about my situation and I didn't go into duct about my uncle situation
my uncle was so young he was so motivated he loved anyone everyone that
came into his life from me as an example
he was there for me whenever I needed him he was the best thing in my entire
life
my mother was 15 when she had me and my father was 16
they never got married I would always go and visit my mom's side of the family
every once in a while
every time I went there he was always there he always played with me
he I don't even know how to explain he was the best
he was such an amazing one goal to me and as I grow older I got a phone call
thing that he committed suicide and that was really hard for me because if you're
close to someone especially in your family you
you don't you don't know how to react to you you feel down
I remember going to fold the next day and I couldn't even do my work I
couldn't
I can't focus because it really took a toll on me
I used to sell farm and I know it's a little crazy to think that someone on
youtube someone that you think this is as an inspiration with self-harm and i
just want to let you know that I know exactly what you're going through if
you're going through this
it's a very hard step and
it's very hard to get over I remember my situation at home was not the best
I don't really know how to put this into words without my family seeing this
video but living at my father's house was very hard for me and the only way to
satisfy myself
what's hot and I remember every time i would get grounded or get into trouble
my dad would always ask to see my rest and he would always ask to see my legs
and he would always ask to see my stomach every time because once he found
out that I self-harmed team you to look and those exact places you don't really
it's really hard to stop
especially if you're in a really hard situation and I completely up completely
understand that because i have been through that and i just want to let you
know that you're not alone you
I found people that I could talk to I found people that I could look up to for
me to stop and I've even tried to commit suicide and and what
when you get at such a low point in your life and you get to a point where you
don't give a shit
you don't care about anything you don't care about what you've done to your body
you don't care about what you've done to your friends what you've done to your
family
all you care about is getting out of this dark hole that is all you care
about in when you're in this place when you're in this place your mind that your
focus on one thing and you're focused on getting out getting out can be so
harming your getting out could be trying to commit suicide getting out can mean
losing your life and I remember one night I grabbed
record i grabbed I don't really want to go to death with off this but i just
want to i know that i've tried to commit suicide myself and it didn't work
and once I fell to the ground
I realize this is not what I want I want a life where I can start fresh
anyone else that that brought me down
does not need to be in my life everyone that I never believed in me
didn't need to be in my life the only thing but yet I needed to care about
with myself and getting to this realization will take me a very very
long time and my whole high school year I went through one hole on high school
year
trying to get through trying to get through my whole high school year trying
to be money itself and not worrying about what happened at home or what was
going on at home because I wanted to be better I wanted to do better for myself
and I knew that once I got out of high school I wanted to be by myself but I
wanted to let by myself
now I wanted to do things for myself I just want to let you know that horse
that and when he will bring you down there are jealous of you
so they know that you're going to be a success
I don't have everything in the world and not a millionaire i don't i'm not with
my father my family want me that I'm not in a place where they want me to be but
i'm happy i have a wonderful fiance
I have a wonderful
family my dog and date when I love my job I love being able to make videos
that helping you guys I love what I'm doing and if I never made a decision
when i use self harm and when I tried to commit suicide
where would I be I wouldn't be proud of myself
I want to be proud of what I'm doing I wouldn't be proud of inspiring so many
people out there
I wouldn't be where I am today and I just want you to realize that there's so
much ahead of you
you may think you're in a terrible spot right now and I'm not saying you aren't
you
you probably are but i just want to let you know that it gets better
it may not take it say it may not take weeks it may not take a few months it
may take a couple years you'll get to where you want to beat and you'll be
happy
you may not make others happy but you'll be happy for yourself and I just want
you to realize that there is so much to live for
there are so many people that you'll meet that will stick behind you
and there will be so many people out there that will love you for you and I'm
one of them
I will love you I would I don't know you as a person face-to-face
I don't know you as a person but I want to meet you and I want to get to know
you and I want to be there for you
I want to be that person that you rely on and that person that you look forward
to telling how your day was
and what you did today and what you're going through because I wanted that when
I was younger but i love you and i thought i should have gone into depth
about this and I just want to be there for you
so have a good day have a good night i love you all
goodbye
