hi guys is Johnny and today I'm going to be talking about losing someone in your
life like a family member or friend
so yeah I figured I have some experience sadly with losing people in my life and
feared I would make a video about it to try to help you guys so when i was
around 12 years old my dad got cancer and i just remember my parents coming
home randomly and like I didn't even know they were going to the hospital or
whatever to get them checked out but apparently they just came home and he he
said that he had cancer and i don't really know what the time entirely what
that was because I was 12 years old so it was all really new to me but he had
cancer I guess
and
so yeah we would have to go to the hospital and stuff and he would you know
get checked out and stuff every now and then and have to take medicine and he
wasn't feeling good and you puke all the time and my mom I have to take care of
him
my mom was like super scared all the time and I didn't really know what was
happening
I just thought it was cool because my dad got to stay home and I gotta hand
off my dad and I was I didn't really I didn't know I don't even know like
people died really like I mean I was 12 and really get it that people once
they're dead they're not coming back
like it's not a video game or something and had think I didn't get it so I
didn't really know how to take it but I just remember my dad being a home and he
wasn't doing well and he would puke a lot and he won't be able to use the
restroom and he was just really really bad
it really sucked I remember the the doctors randomly telling us that he got
stage-four cancer which is really really severe and pretty much one day when he
was at home
he passed away and i woke up two firemen and police officers being inside my
house
take my dad out and I woke up to my sister crying on me like I'm sure my
brother and sister had to like kick down the door to get my dad out of the room
and stuff and they found him dad and my sister is fucking so sad and crying and
my brother was shaking and terrified and they were just like holding me and I saw
like police officers and stuff coming out with my dad like on like one of
those bad things i don't remember what they're called
uh-huh and it was really really scary and I don't really understand that that
was the last time I was going to see my dad
so then we drove to the hospital and the doctor came out and pretty much told us
that he was gone and have a my whole like family was there and everyone's
like really really sad crying and going crazy and I was really like stressed out
excited
understand what was going on and I was just like overwhelmed by old like to see
my family like her my mom was so sad
everyone was like so fuckin sad and it's sucked because it
I don't know just no one should have to deal with losing somebody that they love
we're losing somebody in general it's just not something that should happen so
it really sucked and then I got really really really depressed and I went to
therapy for depression and cutting and not doing well I would pretty much self
harm all the fucking time and I wouldn't go to school every single day i missed
months of school and then about like a year after that I had to go to a mental
hospital because I was self-harming so bad and I was starting to kill myself a
hold the time and it was just really tough and I was really scared and I had
to go through this mental institution for about a week and I was really scared
i feel like i was wanting to live at all was fucking terrifying
I guess why I'm making this video is just to tell you guys that life can
really fuckin suck and you can lose people that you really really love and
it might seem like it's never going to get better and it might seem like
killing yourself or giving up on life is really the best solution and honestly i
can guarantee that life is going to suck a lot of the time it's going to fucking
suck but life is worth living and you will get through all the bullshit that
you have to deal with
I believe in you and it just sucks that people have to go through such terrible
things and I just want you all know that it will get better
it might not seem like it will ever ever get better but it will
so believe in yourself because it will truly truly get better
even though it might seem like it hasn't gone better trust me it will
see how I just wanted to make this video to tell you guys I really love you and I
really do care about you and I know a lot of you go through such terrible
freaking things and I just want you to know that people care about you a lot
and they love you very much and no one wants to lose you
yeah if you guys need somebody to talk to i'm going to put a suicide hotline in
the description and I i hope this video helps you I'm very nervous about making
it I'm very nervous diet
people are going to be really rude on it and I'm very nervous that I didn't say
exactly what i wanted to say and I did you know say everything I wanted to say
it but I just got to get this out because I want to help people and I want
people to know that they're not alone
and people do care about them so let me guess so very much and stay happy not
copy
life's a bitch . quick peace out the bugs love you guys
