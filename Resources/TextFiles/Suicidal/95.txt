hey everyone i'm making this video because a lot of you have reached out to
us who are contemplating suicide or self-harm
they're making this video to tell my story and to show you that that's not
the answer and that you're not alone
so much you know that before I realized it was a lesbian I dated men stories
about my first love my first heartbreak and my experience with suicide
I moved to Atlanta for Mississippi right after i turned 18
a few weeks after I moved here I began speaking to the sky in England to went
to a school that i had originally been interested in going to immediately we
hit it off and soon enough
we were in a long distance relationship
everything in the beginning was
like a fairy tale he was amazingly handsome and very kind and charming
it was just like a dream for me early on there started to be some sort of issues
with like jealousy didn't like that I had to be around a lot of guys in movies
and stuff like that
I went to England about 31 months after we met three months after that he came
to United States to meet my family we decided he should move here to be with
me so we moved here and I realized quickly that it probably wasn't the best
of ideas we started fighting and arguing
it's all about a month after he moved here just didn't seem like the right
time so I suggested that we take a break
I was devastated and so is he but he he agreed
in the end that it was a good idea and that he would go back to England until
we got a little further along in our careers
about three weeks passed and i got a call he said you've ruined my life and I
don't know how I can go about you hate that you've done this
I said you know we have to live our lives we just have to give it a couple
of months because in a couple of months we can get back together for the sake of
this story and for his privacy i'm going to refer to him as James
so the next night I was on a set filming something
and i got a call and i went out i missed it and I went out to go check the call
for a voicemail and it was James and he was crying and he said I just want to
tell you that I love you
chrissy and that i think you're going to do great things but I can't live my life
like this and I cannot be with you so i think i'm just going to end everything
tonight i have to say that was probably the hardest thing I've ever heard in my
life up to that point and it felt like somebody shot a cannon ball into my
stomach and I just collapsed started screaming on the ground because I knew
he was serious
so I called him back and I was trying to reason with him
he didn't want to be reason with his voice was dead and he had just given up
hope i get someone else's phone to try to call the suicide hotline
they refused to help me they said it was privacy issues and that they couldn't do
anything just to talk to him
I checked my phone and i miss another call from him and it said secrecy
I love you and I hope you have a really great life
I just wanted to say goodbye and then I don't know how long it's gonna take for
these pills to start working
yeah
I just started screaming and crying because I think I never really lost
someone
me before like that I got someone I was in love with or direct family member or
anything like that and it was the worst feeling I've ever had
world
especially because he said he was trying to do it because me
so I called him back and I was crying and he was crying and now is to be done
it and thank you would you take any set morphine
I said how much he said 30
they were so release morphine so for the next three and a half hours or so
I was on the phone with him was in about 10 minutes
oh I'm taking the pills he started to go through the effects of like an overdose
so we started feeling really weak and really tired and his speech started to
slurp and then eventually he's trying joking and controls
I never was listening to him die on the phone
sleep watch him time to cool off every second that went by was doing more
damage to his body and that was in a couple of hours he was gonna be dead
I was on the phone with the place in the other year they just kept saying try to
keep him away he said I am gonna die chrissy and then i'm going to die I want
to pray and so the police were like will try to reach up his phone
they said hang up going back and one minute and talk
I Andhra and I told him I loved him and I called him back
one minute later and i asked him if he had prayed and you said yes and I finish
the rest of the pills and he had taken 30 more and the police weren't really
getting nervous
they weren't going to be able to find him and his mom and his sister
we're upstairs asleep finally I heard her and I convinced him to give the
founder and as soon as he got the phones are you just was like on the floor
passed out
she picked up the phone and I just screaming I was like you've got to get
to the hospital he's not gonna make it you have to get him to the hospital has
taken all your pills and she started to freak out and then she said well you
know why he did this don't you
and
I said I tried to convince him otherwise she hung up on me and they ended up
getting them to the hospital and the hospital gave him the wrong care they
give him a shot to counteract regular morphine
they they were supposed to get me an IV and they sent him to a psych ward
because they thought he was just depressed about 12 hours after you got
to the hospital his heart stopped and the nurses came to check on him and he
was blue and they had to wheel him from the psych ward to the emergency room and
it took him about 13 minutes
and for those 13 minutes he was without oxygen to his brain and so they had to
resuscitate him twice and his lungs collapsed and his kidneys failed and
then he was in a coma for over a week and when he finally emerged he was in a
vegetative state and severely brain damaged my life just kind of fell apart
and i had to go home to Mississippi my family I was in the hospital for a week
because it couldn't sleep and I was thinking so saddle thing because I felt
like how could anybody do this to another human being I don't deserve to
live
I became convinced that the only way that I could continue living my life was
if I could see him one more time
my dad and i flew to England to see him in the hospital and I know it's gonna be
really hard to see him for the first time his family warned me that he was
bloated from all the fluids in his body and that his eyes were open but he
couldn't see
I saw the cat scan
his brain
his brain was just like well she is praying that they said was a much isn't
so much damage
so I tried to prepare myself and then I went around the corner looked at him and
I just started crying because this man that I've been so in love with it was so
strong and so we had some and smart was reduced to just being in a hospice
waiting to die
spraying so damaged tubes coming out all over his body and his face just off to
the side with his eyes and a dead stare a couple weeks after i left it send him
to rehab
eventually when you started to make a bit of recovery his family got me on
they stopped letting me get updates on how he was doing I was over here in the
states they were in England and his sister started to target me because she
accused me of doing this to her brother and
that she would call me randomly and say you know I really hope that you kill
yourself because the fact that you could do this to another human being is crazy
and i hope that you die if I ever find you and I come to the United States
I will kill you myself because I promised him I would do that
I of course believed all of these things and i ended up in the hospital several
times is a panic attacks i was already in therapy
I was taking all sorts of pills myself he couldn't take the pain of love having
the weight of someone's life on my shoulders and being blamed for it every
day when I it just got too overwhelming and that night in my sleep
I woke up I went and I took 30 tylenol PM on top of the 10 or 12 other pills
that are already taking and I woke up I couldn't breathe and
I just ended up passing out of my kitchen floor because I figured if I was
gonna go i'm probably deserved it
and of course i ended up waking up and I call my therapist and I said I don't
want to die because of this i really want to live even though it hurts and i
got rid of all my girls and the next day I had my mom bring my dog to Georgia
Jenny and I started having to get out during the day after about nine months I
went out to California and shot the Proactiv commercial and it was out there
that I was like I deserve to have my life back and I deserve to be happy
again because this was not my fault
James still has severe brain damage
and eventually I guess recovered to a point where he could consciously blame
me for this
and so now he blames me for having to be in a wheelchair and having mental
disabilities because of his brain damage
he is very angry and hateful towards me because of his family saying that i did
this to him but eventually I had to realize that you can't control other
people's actions but you can control your own
he didn't have to do this and you don't have to do this
and if you're someone who is known to one that's lost someone it is not your
fault either
he had a choice and he didn't make it because he was overwhelmed in a moment
where he was hurting
I had a choice and I was lucky enough to wake up and make it and I did and now
this is what I've done with my life
you can find light in the darkness thing Scott brighter for me and I never
thought that they would having a moment of
weakness and a moment of sadness even if that moment last four years four months
you can overcome it you can overcome it and you can do amazing things with your
life
my life is still a healing process 30 would tell you that there are still days
where i get sad
our days were i'll feel upset and then my subconscious will try to blame me for
it or his sister will still call me even though it's going to be a lifetime of
healing
it's also a lifetime of learning and I've learned so much because this
you can turn devastation around into hope and you can turn hope and happiness
anytime you feel like you're in so much pain you can't go on
just take a step back from it and try to remember what makes you happy or try to
reach out to a loved one or two groups like the trevor project or just go
outside for a walk see the beauty of life ending it's not worth it
I want to tell you that there are perfect strangers out there who love you
and care very very very much about your happiness your safety and your
well-being

there's me and bria there's Stevie area we get
daylin Angelica killin and Lucy

reasons that were on here is to help people and to try to give people hope
