what's up guys so today at my video is a little bit different I didn't really
plan out what I was going to say I think it's better if it's just raw and organic
i have wanted to make this video for the longest time but I wanted to be sure
one hundred percent that I was healthy enough to make this and clear-headed
enough to talk about it when I was in junior high or middle school I was in
seventh grade at that point in my life I had began to experience bullying
honestly the volume was absolutely brutal it was verbal it was emotional it
was mental it was physical I was so young I didn't understand I didn't know
why people were being so mean to me it really just confused me
I had never experienced that kind of cruelty in my life so I was bullied from
about eight grade
throughout my high school it really really took a huge toll on me
that's when my depression started I got really really depressed when I was about
14 is when I started to self-harm
I know a lot of people don't really understand it but I was in so much
emotional pain
I couldn't handle it and I took it out on myself physically about 15 I started
to dabble into drugs and alcohol
I pretty much used anything to numb
what I was feeling I did not want to be living in reality i did not want to be
living at all no one was nice to me i didn't know why I didn't have friends so
I started abusing drugs and alcohol and it just got really out of hand which
landed me in rehab for the first time the first time to treatment it was just
for drug abuse and alcohol abuse
I stayed there for 30 days I came out and for the most part I was fine i
stayed clean but I didn't have a way to numb my emotions anymore i didn't have a
way to cope so i replaced drugs alcohol with cutting that became in itself a
huge issue for a very
very long time my family found out about it my friends found out about it which
only high into the bullying it just made it worse it people said the nastiest
things to me I remember getting phone calls and text messages and messages on
myspace telling me that I should kill myself because I wasn't worth it that I
should cut my arms and die because no one would care my existence was not my
existence was not important
and when you when you get them bombarded with those messages every single day
it takes such a big toll on you mentally my depression was so out of control that
suicide was the only option for me I was taken out of school because I was so
sick was put in a mental ward for about five days which was extremely scary that
experience was horrific
can a mental ward and of course people at my school found out about that as
well which just it gave them more ammunition to attack me with from the
bullying and abuse that I experienced i developed PTSD which is post-traumatic
stress disorder that's the point where i could not go out in public i wouldn't
leave my room
I was bedridden for a very long time I was scared out of my mind to go to
school to go out in public for people to see me
everyone knew me as the cycle girl who went to rehab who went to a psych ward
I went back to rehab the second time when I was 17 and this time it was for
my depression and my self harm issues and
it was a very good experience that 30-day stay at that treatment center was
honestly a lifesaver and I'm so thankful now that I reached out and I got help
halfway through my senior year I dropped out and i finished up my school online
and I graduate online and then went to call it was very ok i was doing fine i
was recovering i was going to therapy
I was taking my medication wasn't hurting myself for the most part I was
fairly steady for about a year and a half last April was the third time that
I went to treatment it was following another very bad episode of depression
and self destruction and at that point my third time going to treatment I went
in there and I was angry I was so frustrated that I spent five years of my
life hating myself hating the life that I was living hating everyone around me i
was still tired of feeling like shit
I don't want to feel like shit anymore i'm tired of this
I want to be healthy I went in there so motivated to change because this isn't
the life I want I don't want to feel like this
I flew to treatment center in california and i stayed there for a month
honestly it was life-changing when you put your mind to something and you
decide that you want to change something in your life and you work your butt off
to make sure that change happens you will see results
it was a very painful process for me to dig into old wounds and process them and
work through them
well working through them helped me move past them I learned to forgive
I learned to accept now i am sitting here is December 2014
I honestly I have not felt so together and hole in since I was 13 amount of
progress in the amount of things that it changed in my life is
and as I decided that this wasn't the way I wanted to live
I'm happy now I'm a happy person i have dr i have ambition I'm going to college
to be a psychologist
I'm moving away to a university in a year have an internship at a support
group where I am actually coaching kids who were in the same position i was i'm
using what I went through and I'm directing it into a positive direction
and I'm helping others now anyone who is watching this if you struggle with
anything from bullying from depression from PTSD from anxiety if you have any
sort of mental illness
it is nothing to be ashamed of you are in control of your own happiness
if you don't like where you are you don't have to stay there if i had not
reached out and asked for help and surrendered and said I need help
I can't do this I honestly I do not think I would be alive right now
it's a conscious decision to decide that I want to be healthy
I want to be happy I want to have a wonderful life and understanding that
I'm worthy of life as people who believe me those people said I had nothing to
offer
well look at me now I have the most amazing future ahead of me
I am so excited for the things that I have going on for me
I know my worth now and it took me so long to even see myself as a person of
worth
mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of mental illness is a real thing
depression is not a mood
depression is not something that you can snap out of it is a illness just like
diabetes
just like cancer and you have to treat it as such so please by all means if you
are struggling reach out for help because you are so worthy you have so
much to offer the world and i know you may not feel like that right now but you
do if I can pull myself out if I can recover then you can you absolutely hand
that kind of sums up my video when we're done talking about serious and stuff
I love you all have a great rest of your week i will see you next week
you to everyone who
watches me and stuff and puts up with me and tolerates me because I really
appreciate everyone who supports me you guys are honestly amazing so thank you
