I don't really know how to like start this off some steam go for it on my
phone because I cannot seem to find my video camera charger for lots of me and
pretty much dead so I want quick quick I don't know really write anything down
for this coming off the top of my head it's my anniversary of the day I tried
to commit suicide
know technically its November 10th but I'm going to upload this November 11
I don't really know I just letting you know that right now if you don't want to
hear how I think you should probably not much just cause I'm gonna go into
details not like no other night lakes and I'm doing mister are committed to
anything because I wanted to be real so how clinton or it was its Veterans Day
so my whole day when I didn't have school and I worked after school program
run the schools when there's no school there is no which means I don't work too
many school or work I went and i ended up babysitting for kid and I
just gonna watch as this one person I have to have to share this I can't just
wave a lying to me my boyfriend knows about it and just so I can use to be out
in the open and I felt for my side and how I thought when it was all going down
as I was babysitting was texting my ex-boyfriend who lived in Arizona the
time I did something very bad right after we broke up and he felt the need
to practically like 40 to my face was all my fault
and that I was a horrible person there after I was done babysitting and we
stayed on the phone for two hours and she badgered me here
yelled at me saying we were together and sheer ennui and her frankly we were
broken up for about two weeks and the whole breakup was really really hard on
me and he really right after we broke out so I was in pain I was coming I was
putting myself and nothing seems to be working I was just an emotional wreck
and that he felt the need to do this
upon everything that he did to me I couldn't live with myself anymore I
started to believe that I was a horrible person I deserved to be badgered I
and I just felt the need but whatever he was thinking was right about me I was a
horrible first thing I did not deserve to live so I decided that I wasn't going
to and so I got home ate dinner with my mom and your bad went and took a shower
to be clean and shop for clothes are asking where I had had a lot of problems
I just got done with my tonsils removed and so there's a lot of pills in the
house and so we're going to shower even put makeup on
too pretty to any room I blow dried my hair
make their dead look pretty for memorial services kind of what I wanted to look
like sitting there in my room and I was contemplating I was crying make a
prescription timer he was questioned whether or not I really wanted to do it
because I was really her mama and ironically the guy who made me want to
kill myself was don't want to see me he called me and continued to call me then
he threatened to call the cops to stop me and he was so blinded by his
narcissistic personality it that he didn't even know he was the reason why I
wanted to kill myself he realized he made me realize that all the things that
you were saying about me were true I started to believe that I couldn't live
with myself knowing I was hurting people around me and I was hurting myself I
just wanted to end it when he called me I continuously process and call because
I did not want to talk to me anymore and then when you shouldn't saying that he
was going to call the cops on me like to pick up or call the cops picked up there
and I literally was not really talking into it
I just I was just on the phone he was talking we were in silence I really do
not want to talk to him but i also really do not want him to call the cops
on me or tell my mom or anything like that so we're just on the phone
and then sneak me and I was way too tired I just want to go to bed I
remember they just kept telling him I just wanna go to bed are you gonna be ok
gonna try to kill yourself but he continued to ask me for my address was
really weird and this will not let me go to bed and i just want to see it here
because I just wanted to go to bed I was so tired I just want to go to bed and
buy anything like pretty much made me stay alive not to give myself because I
would be hurting people more by not being on this planet then I were then I
would if I just ate so this is kind of like you know my suicide story it's home
to people is a lot better because I know people are gonna make you gonna hurt
people more if you kill yourself then you if you may be hurting but you will
get through it and other people will help you get through my mom helped me
get through but this is Patrick's times actually be the true story about the day
I'm scared myself
and she and I just think you I think everyone who has stayed in my life
through everything through all of my thank you
hope you guys enjoy this video and I hope it helps people
