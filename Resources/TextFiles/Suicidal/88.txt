hi so today I'm gonna make a video on something that people are really
uncomfortable talking about myself included
it's a video i wanted to make for a really long time but I wasn't exactly
sure what I wanted to say how I wanted to say and I just didn't want to like
pre-planned too much i just wanted to come out naturally and kind of like
share my story I guess so yeah a lot of you guys don't know that I struggled
with depression for about a year
my freshman year of college and it's such a common thing like its genetic
it's a problem it's a chemical imbalance with your brain so it's just like any
other sickness just like having mono which i also did have during my freshman
year and for some reason I'm so much more comfortable telling people oh yeah
i left school because i had mono been telling people oh yeah I love schools
that impression so I don't know why we get so weird about it it's just a really
weird topic we're so uncomfortable talking about mental health when really
your mental health is just as important as your physical health and your
well-being in general the reason I'm making this video is really because if
it even helps one person or makes one person feel less alone then it's worth
it for me even though it's a touchy subject and something i don't really
feel comfortable talking about
so my freshman year of college I went to USC this was this past school year and I
was super excited and things were going pretty well I was in a sorority I had
some really great friends I had a best friend and even though things were going
well and I was so good at pretending I was happy was like really really easy
for me it came naturally so I don't think anyone suspected it basically I
was so unhappy unhappier than I've ever been in my life and I was confused
because I wasn't like the school was fine like it wasn't great but things
were going well there was really no reason for me to be so upset but I was
basically in bed in my dorm crying hysterically not wanting to get out of
bed stopped going to class and didn't really tell people i mean i did have
mono like I was physically sick as well but I didn't tell people why I was like
really sad I was just like oh yeah i'm missing class because i have mono i'm
super tired but really
I was in bed unable to get out of bed never been so upset in my life crying
looking to the side of the wall so my roommate wouldn't see me and just
bawling and like trying to like hold it all and so my roommate Hannah wouldn't
notice so i stopped showing up to sorority functions I stopped going to
clog I feel like there was a great cloud above me like this dark cloud that was
following me everywhere but anyway I finally decided to seek help which was
the best decision i made i reached out to a psychiatrist and we had a meeting
and we were supposed to have two 45-minute meetings one week 1 the next
week and she was going to determine whether it was me not liking school that
made me so upset
whether it was something wrong with my mental health day we were just going to
figure out what it was and try to get through it I honestly thought about
death 24-7 it was all I wanted to do is die I will take naps during the day or
at night and stay on my couch all day no computer no TV there's nothing that I
really wanted to do except sit there and lie there and cry and that sounds really
dramatic but I'm just telling you straight how it was
that's my story that was what was happening with me when I was depressed
and I got out of it and I'm doing really really well like better than I've been
doing in so long I think I finally started to like found to find myself and
kind of accept myself more for who I am and not be so hard on myself and really
stop caring what people think and if anything my depression has been a
blessing it's taught me so much about myself I've learned so much from and
I've grown as a person and i'm going to talk about what it was like going
through it and kind of getting out of it and depression is like this dark dark
hole you just keep thinking these negative negative thoughts and you just
like kind of thrive off it like it almost feels good to cry and almost
feels good to like I don't know what you almost don't want it to end because this
feeling that you're so used to now you're like I don't even want to get
better like I can't imagine getting better like I'm in this whole this dark
hole and I don't want to get out of it like this is where I am I'm either die
or I'm going to just I'm so sad and like it just honestly I'm just telling it out
was like
it's soft like honestly so if you're going through it
what I have to say it does get better you're going to seek help you're going
to either get medication that works for some people it doesn't work for other
people I'm on medication i'm still on it to this day
medication really helped me and the hardest thing for me was to believe that
I was going to get better because when i was in like the darkest darkest day of
my life I've never thought about death more I've never been so happy I've never
cried so much and I never felt so just dead dark cloud over me when I was in
this phase i didn't think there was anything I could do to get better it
really was a dark cold that just goes and goes and you just kind of get that's
what my therapist would say to it was like kind of like you're in the rabbit
hole and you just take yourself deeper and it's you thrive off the sadness like
you like it almost it's this sick twisted thing on anyway I didn't see
myself getting better i didn't want to get better i didn't see the point
honestly all I thought about was dying in an accident i felt like suicide was
like way too selfish but if i died in an accident that would be ideal which
sounds so awful and it's like really hard for me to even say this i'm so
surprised i'm saying this honestly but yeah I didn't really trust my
psychiatrist she told me you're on medication that medication is going to
fix the chemical imbalance in your brain and you will get better it just takes
time
it's a sickness just like any other sickness just like mono that I did have
and told everyone i left school because of mana which was half true i guess just
like having a cold it's a sickness and I don't know why it's so much we're going
to talk about and it's so embarrassing kind of it so I don't know it's so like
taboo the subjects but we get depression when we get any other sickness and so
it's going to get better once you have the right medication and it's not gonna
be easy and it's not going to kill you right away and it's not gonna kill you
for the rest of your life you have to yourself kind of yourself out of that
hole and not let it get to the point where you're just like just the point
where you're like all right all i can think about his death because that
people's way out people do commit suicide forces
was awful thing in the world and I wish I could just tell them like I promise
you get better if you get on the right medication if you find something you're
passionate about you need to find something that makes life worth living
for besides your parents besides your friends because you're already feeling
guilty that they are not like making you want to live like you think oh I have
the best family I have the best friends like why do I still think about death
all the time so you need to find something that you're passionate about
and if you're in a situation that's not healthy for you and it's not a good
situation you need to get out of that situation
someone I asked them yesterday told me they were abroad and chili for the year
and they really hated it was really affecting their mental health and they
were really feeling mentally not well and they felt defeated that they have to
leave and they're like I don't want people at home or my family or friends
to judge me for leaving and not being able to stay abroad and I say that was
the smartest thing you could have done
you need to get yourself passionate about something and you need to get
yourself out of a bad situation and that's my biggest advice
you can't let yourself stay somewhere and hope that things are gonna get
better in that same place you need to change your surroundings if you're in an
unhealthy environment that doesn't help your mental health and it hurts it and
that was USD for me and that's a big reason why i love that place reminds me
of when I was in the worst times i'm honestly scarred from it going back
there is really weird for me even I have to like I'm follow people on Instagram
not as a roofing but just because seeing people at USC it was so it was almost
like post-traumatic stress like I start crying hysterically and I have these
memories in these flashbacks the worst time of my life so I'm so happy i love
that environment I'm so happy I'm changing environments and I was a
hundred percent the right decision for me ask for finding a passion that
passion for me was YouTube honestly my biggest problem with self-acceptance I
didn't want to wait because i hated the way that I was i thought i would always
say myself I hated the way I acted around my friends I hated the way active
and I was depressed when i was just all sad all the time I hated the way i
looked i hate the way i dress I hated that I had no motivation for school i
basically just it was like a whole cycle of self-loathing and basically my
depression and going through the war
first help me find myself and finally accept myself and I can't really give
you tips for that because that's something that just happened for me once
I was on medication
once i started a YouTube once I left the terrible environment the environment
that was so bad for my health my mental health
it just kind of came to me i started youtube and for me that was like my
saving grace if I hadn't started a YouTube I don't know where I would be
right now and that's why I really think lauren elizabeth Shannon kay parker and
fouled out because they really inspired me to make my channel I never would have
made one if it weren't for them so thank you are in kc Nana um I honestly thank
you so much and oh so much of my recovery to you guys and starting a
YouTube was something i never wanted to do because not only did I care what
other people thought about myself I care what I thought about myself I was my
harshest critic and I was like that's so embarrassing you can start a YouTube
like what are people going to think like you're a loser like I was just so
worried myself it was really terrible to think that say to myself I look in the
mirror and I would just cry and I was like you suck basically like as blunt as
that is so um I started a YouTube and it started to make me happy and I started
to care less about what people thought at first I was still kind of embarrassed
it's something I've always wanted to do but if someone asked me about a
political yeah it's this dumb thing i do just like whatever or if someone found
it i do super embarrassed i wouldn't even let my mom tell her friends or our
family about it because I was so embarrassed and then finally one day I
just posted the link on my facebook and i don't know how i finally got to this
like peace with myself when I was able to like where i was able to just share
it with the world and not be ashamed and just admitted to everyone and kind of
complete about it and for me that was a huge step and that really helped me
except myself and accept what i was doing and be proud of where I've caught
on i mean i've had a lot of cool opportunities from YouTube and now i'm
really proud of it and yeah anyway I'm getting off track for me youtube was
what saved me and I really think Lauren Jenna cana for me getting out of that
environment was was what would save me and trying to find something you
honestly the
every one thing I can tell you if you're going to get through your depression is
that it will get better you need to seek help you can't just try and get through
it alone
you can't ignore the symptoms or the signs if you feel then you just can't
you can't try and hide it or pretend you're okay because you're just gonna
end up
I don't even know where I would end up today if I hadn't detail i think my
therapist so much i have two therapists were helping me through it for so long
and now i'm out of therapy I just see my psychiatrist every so often to make sure
my measure ok and i am really really happy right now I'm nervous but I'm
excited for SBC I'm excited to see where my youtube will take me a few girls and
I are starting a collab channel on youtube i'm excited to see what happens
with that and I'm just excited to see what happens with my life and i'm really
happy i went through the roughest toughest times because I came out a
stronger person and I learned to accept myself finally
and I wouldn't be here on YouTube talking to you guys today and hopefully
entertaining you guys if it weren't for my depression and so I'm thankful for it
honestly I don't want you to feel bad for me I'm in a great place right now it
may be such a better person and I'm so happy it happened to me as crazy as that
sounds
and if you have a friend going through this and you need advice on what to say
to them or how to react
I'm definitely contact me on tumblr ask them and if you're going through this
right now please contact me too i'm always here to talk i really want to
talk to you guys anyway looking back on it when I think of myself when I was
depressed like that it's hard to even think that was the same person that I am
now and I'm really grateful that I'm so out of that dark hole but yeah that is
basically all i wanted to stay today I'm hopefully help some of you guys and i
know it i didn't get that many tips because you have everyone has their own
journey and i can't just give you this secret success to escaping depression or
escaping your problems and getting through to the other side because it's
different for everyone but what I do want to say is that hopefully this video
makes one person feel less along know that there's someone to talk to and know
that even the happiest people I think I look so happy on the Internet
you look at my life it looks really cool and exciting which luckily i do have a
cool life I have great friends and great family i had this great passion which is
YouTube but basically I just want you to know that even the happiest people even
the people you look up to so many people have gone through depression it's pretty
common you're not the only one and i'm always here to talk so thank you so much
for listening to me and my story and this video is super weird for me so
hopefully you don't judge and hopefully you enjoyed it or hopefully wasn't to
side
