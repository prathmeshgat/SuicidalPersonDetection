he has my name's torrence we know hope you guys are always crazy excited as I
am to have taken apart up mind it'll escape
welcome JM school have a fellow Canadian part in this where
what anyways this week we're talking about depression and self-harm and some
of those teams
i've seen the videos that the other members have done and the comments on
those videos
they're all very touching and you guys know I'm not a very negative person
but I definitely was it a couple points in my life pretty much there was a stage
in my life where I
didn't know what I was doing back in school I wasn't most popular person
and I really tried to find a group of people who I felt comfortable with but
instead I think I ended up with some really negative people
people who would tell me that I sock that I can't do anything and is pretty
much told me to give up whatever I wanted to do
obviously something like that is happening it starts to eat away at you
after a while
that on top and not really caring about what was happening in school made me
really negative person
a person who I'm not proud of today but anyways I didn't have the most positive
experience for school
coupled with this negativity is the fact that I'm a really deep thinker
like I will actually think too much and I learned really quick that that's
really dangerous
I question things all the time I really do I think about things that I have no
control over what so ever
like emotional pain death uncertainty and it's not fun
and I really worry a lot about those things every day I still do and I know
that there's nothing that I can do to change that
no matter how much I care about something it's not going to change the
fact that I'm gonna lose in one day
and that really sucks I have a lot of things in my life where I just wish you
could stay this way forever
but unfortunately that's not how it works you have to take the negatives
with the positives
if you question things too much like I do love the time you get down to the
answer that
well everything's pointless and why should anything matter
an intern why should I be happy there no definite answers
how do I know anything's going to get better when I finally started thinking
that much about things
I just shut down I didn't wanna talk I didn't wanna make new relationships
I didn't want more people to lose and that's when I stopped caring
and the really sad part about this is I know a lot of you guys are feeling like
that
that a lot if you are going through depression and think well why not
why should I kill myself I've got nothing here for me nobody cares
and there are no answers you look around you and you see a world that is not a
very nice place
I thought like that once and it was one in the lowest point in my life
I don't ever wanna things like that again that's not how you want to look at
things
I talk to my parents family and friends and I really didn't want to because it
felt she easy and
just stupid that I'm really happy that I did
there was a point in my life where I thought being happy with
the dumbest thing ever I thought it was cheesy I thought it was like a fake
emotion
I felt like if I enjoyed anything I was lying to myself but I've grown over the
last few years
and as i've grown I realize that being happy really is the only thing that
matters
spending time with people enjoying your life while you have it that's what's
important and depression gets in the way that and it really sucks
but you should never ever feel like you need to hide it if you need any kind of
reassurance just look at me
I is to be there I know what it's like to feel like nobody cares
and I know what it feels like to think that nothing is going to get better I
started to heal after a while
and I know that you will too keep yourself talking and keep yourself
distracted
I know it sounds really stupid the distractions are amazing go play or
listen to music
go hang out with your friends go to draw something you can find something you're
passionate about it doesn't matter what it is
hungry cat seriously look at him he doesn't even care
he doesn't think about where he's gonna wind up one day his just alive and happy
he's even praying right now guys I just really want you to know that there is
hope
things to get better and you're never alone people do love you
so please don't leave because the people that you're leaving behind would be
devastated
absolutely crushed I've seen people come and go and trust me when I say nobody
wants to see you go
enjoy living while you can I finally accepted things within myself
and it's really as easy as two ways to look at things do I wanna live my life
sad
afraid and worried about things to come or do I just want to be happy and
content with everything that around me
and go on adventures and make the most of my life in this world I know that
shows
I love you guys so much stay with us and
know that people care stay strong and please whatever you do stay safe
i do. the
so
do
and I know
for me
world
I'll
the
so
in
and
homes
