mtn nnat widest McKinsey look like a bull because she thought I was there and it's a fake septum piercing but outposts to get out like halfway through this video because 
I'm sure my mom and everybody else is watching us like that looks really stupid I decided to do my first story times today but it's not really %HESITATION a good story it's kind 
story but 
it's you my experience with you guys of everything that I've been through so obviously I'm if you checked me out of my 
and all 
you've seen that I 
actually had been %HESITATION I've always struggled with depression and I 
so illness as well as you know bullying among 
feeling suicidal and things like that 
I decided to tell you a little bit about my 
story my suicide story and the time that I attended suicide when I was sixteen years old so 
%HESITATION ever since I was really little I voice had really low self esteem and I think that kind of stemmed from my father because of the way he treated me though he was like really like abusive and like I was the only kid out of all of this I feel is hopeful that like he was just that's kind of where it started and 
ever since like even in junior high kids are always going the fat I like I was always told that it was like ugly and I was this and I was that like I remember one time I had a snickers bar is a chilling with my friends I like break time or whatever and one this one and I was like alright and made a remark about a little you know maybe I shouldn't eat the snickers bar like not because I because I was watching a waiter anything but because 
I just 
like I did because I think in the recess is coming to an end or whatever and he was like yeah you definitely shut and 
I was just like people are always calling the fat in like I was saying they really mean hateful things to me and ever since I was little I just I remember I would like violently cries to my mom about like having to wear a two piece swimsuit because I'm like I don't know where it should be some suit like I look fat like I don't have a good some act like everybody else like all my friends of moist skin been skinnier and taller than me you know Morgan was always like super super thin and tall and I was always short and hunted chunky and like whatever 
and 
like now when I go back and I look at pictures of me like I was a kid everything I thought I was like it's the biggest kid in class I just thought it was huge and we go back and look at my pictures and I was just like I wasn't that big at all I think I just 
I mentally like program that in my brain I was like I am obese I am obese and I wasn't it was eighth grade the first time that I ever saw mutilated and what I mean by that is cutting and %HESITATION 
it started with like an eraser like I'd like a race I seen a whole lot until bike scar up and then it would by Angela make like a scab an analyst for up and then %HESITATION what I started doing after that was I just started cutting and I'm not making this video to trigger anyone and I'm just 
making it so we like honest like Hey this is like this is how it was for me 
and it's saws I mean like I had I had cut its all over my wrists and I mean I would show you guys now that like I just don't feel the need to let go that far but I remember sitting in mass %HESITATION like in eighth grade looking at my friend Chelsea's arm like while we're praying 
and I remember being like I totally forgot with my left arm looks like before I had all these cuts and scars answer to getting is really out of hand 
and %HESITATION I would like during gym classes of it during P. E. I would %HESITATION Stanley select locker like shower things %HESITATION never just cut myself like you it was so I just hated who I was about really different I feel you know we got me knows that a Catholic school where nobody was artistic and nobody like 
everyone thought it was lame like even my best friends that I grew up with just started thinking I was like super lame Anna 
it really care about me like at all I'm very like what I wanted to do which is kind of like how can we smoke pot and drink alcohol and get boys to like us so we can have sex with them like that's all my friends here at about I just felt like the black sheep like I really did or the purple sheep I felt like I always said I felt like a flamingo in a flock of pigeons and I still say that to the state because that's what I call the public school that's I just I don't belong there so 
gum freshman year %HESITATION a lot a lot goes down on with this guy I was dating which is going to be a whole another video that I might have to like touch on basically but %HESITATION you know and I was fourteen years old I got rates and on my whole worlds 
changed it was crashing down on me and I just 
I had no control over I didn't tell anyone like nobody really knew %HESITATION and then I was at public school at this time added beginning in my freshman year so I had bags and bags and bags my mom 
to transfer back to the Catholic school 
well my you know childhood friends were because it was I was having a really hard time making friends of this public school and I just felt 
new I just felt really inadequately viscerally there is nowhere to really turn to know who really go and so I went back to 
%HESITATION the private school 
and %HESITATION other my first day back I didn't go actually wanted there be for the first time and in therapy you know my mom you know she had found out about my cutting and like everything I got and she you know it to the therapists %HESITATION either she wants to know what really happened like why why did I leave the public school like what it was so bad like it because my parents were also split up at the time so if they were in the process of like the beginning stages of their divorce which is like a 
three year thing and %HESITATION 
and I was like I was living with my dad at the time and it was that I think it was a whole big mess 
and my mom in therapy you know they want to know really what happened like that because it was obvious that something significant happened and I finally just broke down crying and I told her story of what happened on the night that I was straight 
and the reason I can talk about it now is because I have come to terms with that whole line like 
I mean a lot of people a lot of people lose their virginity that way like they lose that I'm either they get and I say we lose if you really get your virginity taken from you like it was not consensual I'm you know and even at the time like the guy was only a two and a half years older than me so he was like super older than me when I was fourteen I knew him he was also my first boyfriend my first kiss like and everything we have a broken up like we hardly data we take for like two weeks and but he was like he meant so much to me and because like obviously had Daddy issues and I'm like you know whatever 
I think it was it was beyond to study issues like if someone paid the slightest bit of a century of the quotes of them like this not only because a multilevel explosive a scene like all these other issues all these other factors are involved 
so I mean the sky divers who we should really view said whatever when I was in eighth grade they towards intimate buried and that we're probably not for like months like eight seven eight months 
well 
%HESITATION at the end of August so I was like the beginning of my freshman year %HESITATION it was one night that I saw him and %HESITATION 
he asked me to write a two thousand and I'm you know I was like Google you hire this guy like asylums gracing amber and my mom warned me about him here something like I had success you is like I blame myself where because 
I didn't there are things I could have avoided like I could have avoided controversy going to his house and I could have like avoided being like incident with him and like letting him kiss me and stuff like that Blake nomeansno you know and 
I had to understand that like it wasn't my fault it's not something I wanted to do I mean I wore a purity ring 
%HESITATION and it was just really really bad and 
it made me really really messed up in the head so after that it just like everybody else I dated you know following that was just like 
trying to mend my broken heart from wanted been done to me and I just it was just 
like I I felt like I attracted abuse like you got so we are just like everyone and everything in my life was like abusive and that is just I accepted because that's what you know and whatever so my first day back a Catholic school everyone somehow heard 
that you know I had sex with some guy in my jet ski room at my house like I wanna say like it's like the game telephone work like you say the color blue and somebody gets the word unicorn at an event like that's how messed up the story was and it's really sucky because like my best friend I had told her what happened and it was her that spread is everybody so 
whatever your labs that's that so sophomore year I decided I was like okay no I wanna go back to public school look of axis because the reason I want to go to this public schools because of the performing arts high school so I was like 
I want to be in Ireland to deter this is what I do so I'm back and I was always dealing with you know anti depressants and then like getting on mid stabilizers like 
there are peeing in the and psychiatrists and drowsiness out like I was always having to deal with some of that just because I know despite situational depression despite things are inflicting a lot of problems for me I knew a lot of it was chemical make up I like serotonin I knew that I had a chronic depression no matter if my life was going perfect or not 
so at the end of my sophomore year I meet this guy who I was different from anybody else ever met he wasn't from Louisiana %HESITATION and he was super eccentric and that's how it said he was a musician and %HESITATION just really like changed my entire worlds %HESITATION and not look that way 
and that was really really like 
infatuated with him %HESITATION you know because we started seeing each other but I was like really really insane and because 
he was just so mysterious and different and on I was like my dream guy 
so very quickly into our relationship he and I had just turned sixteen at the end of may and we start seeing each other and I very quickly into our relationship 
he %HESITATION was relieved he said and looked just like fall off the face of the earth and liked it should mean like just 
didn't care so again her satellite being attracted to abuse thing like he was just really really bad news and 
he and that he was coming for about myself like he hated %HESITATION my singing voice like he's hated the way I sing arm and he hated %HESITATION theater even though he was a performer like he was a musician he hated theater that he would not come see me and shows and he said it was because you don't want to see me kissing another guy but like 
that was really dumb because that wasn't like 
I just got it once in the whole show twice so like or that it's irrelevant so 
he will never support me in anything and then I got so bad that I like 
I will 
I had to be back like full time and that there be and not socks 
my mom hated them and she knew that he was like 
a big portion as to why things are going bad for me so then the fall of my junior year was just a thousand eleven %HESITATION I actually started like 
we started being good %HESITATION I never met his parents I did me this past like two years 
but %HESITATION things were okay with us like run holidays on new years whenever things are good 
so come February of two thousand twelve this is like the second half my junior year his senior year %HESITATION 
he %HESITATION and I mean he had cheated on me like all the time and I think what I think what the deal is is he started seeing the Scully worked well and so he started distancing himself for me even though we were like Facebook officially we were dating 
%HESITATION 
and everyone had they just had to come to terms with it like as much as my friends hated them so he never came around my friends like they hated him because he was so laid back to me you know I do forget that guy so January I got a really bad breath 
huddling nine thousand dollars in them to my heart was really bad rash and I was living with my dad science you so I was just like not happy my dad's house like he was in an abusive relationship with his girlfriend like there was just so much stuff going on whereas like my dad see the user so it was just a bad toxic environment and I had nowhere to run to my mom and I were talking just a mess 
so me and this guy 
%HESITATION you know he's a sex abuse emailing zero hateful cold and this and I was like you know I 
like I said whatever then then let's just be over and I sent it more it was a good tactics is to make sure that he knew that come back for me you didn't completely cut off cold Turkey 
and so this is what I wasn't on medication or anything and then the next day after we broke up I thought it was okay and I wasn't and I went to well ostrich Dallas is Mexican restaurant for my friend's birthday with a couple of my friends and it was very close in the me music venue that this guy spanned the guy I was dating let's human animals calling George 
George George band was playing at the music when he was just a very close this Mexican restaurant like a good dash like you could run their 
and I started I still get like really really depressed and suicidal and like 
I've been cutting more than ever like during this whole a timeframe of like living at my dad's and everything and %HESITATION 
I %HESITATION I take them as a share alike can we can we please talk to you know you have to show Niagara like him please talk and he was just like hustle me out like one nothing to do with me didn't care what happen to me and so I said to my friends and I said Hey I'm gonna go to the bathroom 
they're like okay 
and I started walking towards the bathroom and I saw the front door and Mexican restaurant and I jetted out I jetted out or and I took off running and I didn't care didn't look back 
did you check my phone nothing just dashed over to this music venue so I listen music manuals like artists do this so I'm already crying against miserable I go and I'm like Hey can we talk like can we please talk and he's like you're crazy like you need to leave you need to leave it like well and I said okay we'll who was she like who are you dating because like I know you can't be by yourself like who who are you saying behind my back I don't understand he's like mackenzie I do not care what happens to you after you leave here I don't care 
like please just leave like whatever it takes we believe I don't care leave 
and then just when he said that something hit me and I was like so you don't care what happens to me ever like you don't you don't care what happens if I walk out of here 
is that I honestly don't 
so turnaround is friend his bandmate was a mile and I pushed him out of my way and I 
and I took off running 
and I want to medium of the highway and I started in the median of the highway 
%HESITATION you know my friends still think I'm in the bathroom of the Mexican restaurant and on this highway if you were going about fifty fifty miles an hour just passing by and I'm standing there and I'm just watching each car and I'm I'm crying so much and then it came to a point where 
I called his sister and I reached out and I said Hey you know just what's going on and what can I do you like what did you do because she had you know suffered from suicidal stuff before and she was like you know this under oath song help me Bubba blah and I was like well I don't want to hear music right now I I really just wanna jump out in front of this car 
so I finally just hung up with her and I drop my phone 
and I just I stopped crying and then it was a moment of 
okay this is what I wanted to 
this this is what I meant to go and I meant to die right now and it was a really calm all weird feeling 
and I had accepted it so I started walking out into the road and %HESITATION 
and just thinking and and all of a sudden like people say your life classes 
by you know bustier my before you die but 
the thing is like it was all negative things like I started thinking about my dad called me fat when I was little you know the guy that raped me that this out like all the kids are coming back grown up like everybody in my life like all the girls that harassed me like on the internet and in social media and always will hate me that's what I thought about 
and as soon as I was okay within I was stepping out to do it a girl on for my high school who actually had also dated storage %HESITATION and another girl she is friends with holds over 
and I was a prince of them actually a beef with them and I they pulled over and they're like Hey like what are you doing larue okay 
and I was like 
yeah I'm fine that you guys can go using go and all this and I snapped out of it like Hey get the car like your mom and your best engineer over at 
you know the music menu like you need to get the car and so I sort of fighting with them and crying because they don't get the corner like a kid in the car 
so I got in the car 
when I was a scream and cry and I like being like really mean and whatever they got back to my mom and I 
and my best friend and they're like Hey we love you all my god kid in the car we're going home 
so this is a good thing I didn't have a car this time the sense of the rack and everything but so I went home 
and I I just laid in the back to my friend laid on the bathroom floor and she just was crying inches thick 
what would I have done like why would I have done if you if you killed yourself 
and I was like 
I don't know 
and I couldn't think clearly and my whole 
I was just sick I was non I didn't feel anything and I 
and the worst part is all I could think about was him 
you know I don't have him anymore and that's the thing about mental illness such a thing about feeling something about abusive relationships do you think that like even when you're trying to kill yourself you still worried about them and I think now that comes in terms of everything I think you know why it why don't you come myself and I think it's really selfless 
%HESITATION it would never solves anything because I would have ruined so many people's lives in my family for 
I guy that didn't care what happened to me and you know me and him later on I believe and I actually made things work and we are engaged in was a very 
very toxic relationship and it's all over now and I'm really thankful and it's been over for %HESITATION you know a year and a half now but 
guys like dole allows someone to be that way it's you because it will kill you literally and %HESITATION 
you know I think I told him I said I think later on after everything was over %HESITATION you know because people are talking about at the music man you know and 
he was a cheese crazies is running man and I'm a lot like I was just running your night while you were only allowed 
okay 
and he said %HESITATION 
was that I think I I think I wanted to do it because I wanted you to feel the hurt that you would put me through for almost a year 
%HESITATION from the moment we started dating the abuse everything and he said 
%HESITATION he said well that's pretty dumb because I honestly probably would have laughed and I would have cared 
that was the only time that I genuinely tried to commit suicide and every time after that %HESITATION 
that I feel suicidal I had been and the good 
surroundings of people and I wonderful mother that loves me and I am 
you know it I lost a friend at the beginning %HESITATION almost a year ago the beginning of two thousand fifteen to suicide and I don't know those juggle late and I don't know if he was 
I don't know 
we just don't want to be here anymore and I understand that I understand that feeling like you have so you go your mind goes a thousand miles a minute you're like I have so much that I want to do and so much 
energy and I I feel so much and 
you feel like no one else gets out in because of that it will really limited and you feel like almost like you don't belong here on earth it's nothing personal you don't love the people in your life of these just 
you know but the thing is is like this this life is beautiful and there are things to get better and I don't believe in medication for me personally I think it serves me my creativity and who I am so I don't do it %HESITATION but there is medication there is there be I think the two things that got me out of everything is music Anna writing and I think if you have a creative outlet dnmt 
like writing or music or acting you're filming there or playing piano or anything like that will save you you know put the negative put your negativity and so are and because of that I haven't cut myself %HESITATION harm myself in over two years and 
really thankful and all those kids I believe me call me fatter 
still doing nothing with their lives so who's the real winner here so I Sunday I'm sure that with the guys and I hope you enjoyed it %HESITATION and I hope you got a little bit and site suicide is not the answer %HESITATION you know I guess I feel better from it from sharing my story with you guys I created a documentary my senior year just don't do it was Ali below in the description box you guys you know check it out and %HESITATION 
it's really you know let's talk about it suicide we don't talk about suicide even though it's preventable but we'll talk about teen pregnancy because that's preventable birth they're preventable so let's talk about it it's not taboo lives matter and suicide doesn't have to happen 
so 
I just wish I like what you guys are like me so much I put something else on here 
Tuesday and every Saturday on the main channel I'll see you later 
why
