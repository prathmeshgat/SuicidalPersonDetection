hey my little candy canes it's candace and today I'm going to be doing a story
time I'm gonna make a disclaimer about it which the title is not clickbait no
I'm and if you here panting in that it's this little dude sister's dog and um
he's a siberian husky and he's panting and kind of walking around my room
because we're babysitting her dogs because today she went to the state fair
at this is for people that are actually going through it or if you are depressed
or for people just to be aware because I've been suicidal thoughts it's no joke
and especially if you try to act on it it's it's terrible like also hate it
when people associate mental health with people being insane or crazy because
depression does not make you crazy anxiety does not make you crazy and
doesn't make you who you are you are you
depression anxiety or not you
they do not define you
so you're struggling with depression anxiety
don't let that define you let you define you
ok now let's get into the story time now and then sorry about my hair to be on it
started to rain and I was outside and my hair got four is easily i'm not a big
fan of it but yeah so I started feeling depressed because i was being on several
bullied which put some screenshots in the video also these are just some the
screenshots are I got bullied even more but I didn't get a chance to screenshot
it so yeah i knows by other people too
the thing is that i was being cyber bullied by people that I didn't know
just made me feel horrible and i remember reading my journal and I was
crying and I was like I'm so done with life which actually i'll go grandma
journal right now
yeah actually I got this notebook or journal whatever you want to call it
from my therapist yeah so is it very long and I guess I'll read it
I'm dear journal it's currently 1222 am and I have been crying for 45 minutes
long
I was cyber bullied by this boy and on thing is that when i was being bullied
that night it happened again the next morning and then the next morning that's
when i tried committing to side result finishing this I didn't even knowing he
called me fat ugly and other things like that i just heard so much since it's
happened so many more times before I feel weak and like I can't take it
anymore i'm having to settle thoughts I was kind of confident before but now
that's gone
I wish I could just end my life i hate myself but I'm just too weak to do it
just because I posted body positivity pictures and I felt confident I don't
want to delete mine scrim but i feel like i should i wish you could just
delete my life no one would care and then i wrote the next day when I took
the pill but you left
ok so then I took on the rest of my medication i take zoloft I'm for my
depression and anxiety and the thing is that i took them right in front of my
brother and I was just feeling so suicidal and I felt horrible about
myself
this was the next day dear journal I am so weak i just took the rest of my pill
lolz there's none left there are only three left
I hope I die I just want the pain to go away and since there are only three
pills left it didn't affect me at all
answer those metal and yeah and also my mom's been locking my pills and like a
safe thing so she had a call like counselors come out to my house and I
felt suicidal not so long ago lake about like a week or two weeks ago and I've
been resorting cutting myself and I'm trying to stop i really just want to
stop because it's not the answer is never the answer to do that
the answer is gained helping people by your side but it's so hard to do that
the same time when so easy to just grab like a blade or like a knife or
something and cut if you are feeling this way at all please tell someone that
you trust and don't tell something like fake ass bitch you think that was your
friend know like tell someone that you really really trust because you tell
someone that you don't trust too much and they're not trustworthy
it could stab you in the back like that fucking sucks because i have trust
issues like that and yeah so that was pretty much i'm sorry for my ratchet
here again it's not cute but neither am i am and i'm a potato and I really hope
someone on found this video helpful and uh yeah and to show that you're not
alone but once you're on that stage and that more
went once you decide like right this is the moment I'm going to kill myself or
alright this is the moment I'm going
also whenever you're feeling the way you can snapchat me DM and really and i'll
try my hardest to respond makes more people realize that they aren't
