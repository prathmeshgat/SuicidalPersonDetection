so this is my first video uploaded to YouTube I'm sorry better still bitter
just don't know what I'm doing really well so I'm going to talk about my
suicide attempts story so easily trigger just a topic that you don't really want
to get into here about what's happening here about it then I stopped watching
them anyway I had been diagnosed with PTSD and depression about 34 years ago
three years ago
it is I can't wrap my head around the fact that I had pressure is it was a
real to me the PTSD I could understand because my father used to it was just
really rough going up and I'm back and forth from Louisiana Minnesota and it
was just a lot of moving around for a kid that China everything at least at
such a young age so they'll always happening and finally moved appear moved
to Minnesota last time my mom got me to like most upset
just everything was good as happy as I believe my old school but overall I was
happy and then I was diagnosed with PTSD depression and i couldnt membrane
impossible for me to understand that I think I was so happy just like I was
just a kid knows she's happy with life care what people I care about myself
everything which is good but I was diagnosed and I know this some of the
things I had asked me questions about Lakehurst long here
isolated myself sometimes I just got him so I would notice those things and then
the mind me because I realized that it was my problem and is your friend to my
PTSD my depression it's just my problem is nobody could understand my problem in
an attack my friends about it it's cool to meet you use it took me seriously not
in my school come saloons
nobody really cared how I felt and then things just a little really bad place I
didn't see myself having a future I just felt I had no purpose of being here
nothing was right people so many people so that's when myself I'm really
starting to come into play if you can see that I'm trying here
I don't know I guess it's not something to be cliche but I feel like if we're
talking about this topic and appropriate so there's that people notice I went to
my friends for doing this I need hopefully somebody talk to me and tell
me somehow they would they would actually cared like one minute don't
focus on it and I just needed somebody at least just one person to just be the
full-time and talk to me and make sure that I was ok but I just got to a point
where I just couldn't take it anymore it was a boy or something but I guess it
was everything piling up in my dad calling for a long time and you jealous
because he he had another kid with his girlfriend so I just felt material
planes because when I was younger he's always gone working out of town and
everything that is felt like I wasn't good enough for him and I didn't like
feeling it that's made so I just had that feeling so I was in my room I was
just thinking about it I would be ok here and not a big part of anybody's
life and kissed the kid that people can pretend to care about its just the
daughter that always messed up and getting in trouble I was always the
space and I didn't I didn't want to be here I was sick of it just another
motivation to get out of bed I would sleep to me in the afternoon
I wasn't ok I can say that no I wasn't ok sometimes I'm still not okay but I
make it to the final was inside just contemplating I sit home and had only
just flash me time to time my arms were just covered in all kinds of cuts and
scratches they were just after that wasn't enough I went to the bathroom
just got a bunch of I took over 200 pills and I just I was ready just be
done just hoping I would give up and I didn't feel my body was like it should
be shutting down how to explain the feeling it's just starting to get slower
and I just didn't feel right so I got scared scared something clicked in my
head just knew I had to keep trying something he needed me here but both my
younger siblings in which they need me so I just got really scared to not be
here
confused who comes up in the middle of the night I saw little pools in my arms
I think she was shocked and happened they got me into the hospital in our
town
when they got me and i was just over around the questions ever do that to me
like how many pills did you take what did you take and when did you take it
like I could remember that stuff like I had a lot of things on my mind I just
couldn't enter the passion that they would let me go to sleep or anything
obviously but I said enough with everybody I thought that was just
sitting in the chair next to me hospital she's just kinda needles in me and in my
hand right if I know they just couldn't find it and they came in this liquid
charcoal and it was disgusting and it made you feel so they gave me that took
me to the city you speakers the hospital or Italian not made for these kind of
crisis
helicopter down there and got to the hospital
hooked up to me he's trying to get my levels back up to make sure that I was
just the whole social workers coming in my room doctors just everybody the whole
time I was just really didn't like it I knew they couldn't leave me alone
managed to stabilize the next day to stay in my hospital bed and watch TV
food and my parents came in and told me that you have to go in the psych ward
and of course me I just wanted to go home
be done with it you can't bring me to say that children's hospital in the
comments i'm doing their thing they put me in my room my parents wouldn't let me
know how many clothes I was gonna say they're eager little over a week I
didn't want to they medicine it a presence in stone house 222 to leave and
the person I was I didn't want them to go they couldn't be there with me but I
didn't want them to go I just want to go home
feel so long new me to be there the first night it was really really hard I
remember I didn't get any sleep just scratching Stanley Credit my roommate
was trying to sleep and i felt really we saw in my bed in my bed was it looked
out straight to look at church God looking down disappointed and just don't
happen in the next couple days we're just kind of we would like to talk about
our feelings and it just didn't like the whole concept I didn't think it was
gonna help me get any better I just wasn't ready to be in that situation I
was ready to talk about my feelings or anything just kind of put me in there
like the day after
comes off as they just put me in a hospital with a bunch of people that I
have no idea who they are in their questions and I think so but I said this
week that they can nominate not everything so it was just weird because
I couldn't even leak could cut anything I could even do i think im crazy is
really hard in treated differently I think that was probably one of the parts
of it aside from being in the hospital I don't know but I think overall after
being in the hospital I definitely got to meet people that we're in situations
similar to think just people understood how I felt after being here for a few
days didn't feel I think leaving when I had to leave the hard part was nothing
if you couldn't contact anybody from inside the psych ward you get you out of
the safe word you weren't allowed to have any contact with anybody that you
were in the same bored with it so I was really hard for me because i connect it
with a lot of people and a lot of the people that I connection with him his
likud stress relief I kind of them how to describe it but I can talk to them
and I didn't feel judged they go to school counselor or therapist or
something and they say they can't judge I feel like I think they do I just was
nice talking to some of my own age
agent with the similar situation and being able to get through to them and
they understood what I was talking about because they've been in that position
that is nice that was really hard not being able to contact anybody
but I think now three years later
16 years old I'm glad that I wasn't successful these days where I feel like
I feel hopeless and I feel miserable I know but there's always going to be a
better day in Minot me today and tomorrow may not even be an elite but
there's always gonna be a better day you coming off people that bring you down
even if you'll open if they bring down you just can't keep it in you like I've
cut off so many people that we're good friends and I look to do but they just
make me unhappy sometimes I just couldn't keep it was too fragile to keep
them in my life myself as a person I don't let people walk used to have
someone calls me a name I'll stick up for myself like when you call me that
like if you can give me about the business name then they should but if
you can't then it just shows how immature and it doesn't bother me
people call me anymore it took me a long time to get right today but I'm really
proud of myself I think if you've been in this situation or a similar situation
even if you are contemplating suicide attempt to anything I think we were
coming down here and I will email Instagram and I will talk to you and I
will help you get through this because I've been in your situation I don't want
anybody to feel that way because it's a terrible feeling I can't help somebody
anybody I just want people to be ok I want everything one of yous be happy
with your self confidence into you are because you are such
unification that's all I can somebody everything out of you it's just
beautiful creation and comment on this and every you got you
