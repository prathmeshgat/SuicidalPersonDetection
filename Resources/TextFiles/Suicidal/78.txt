hey guys so for today's video I'm going to be doing a video about my anxiety and
depression and this video has been highly requested for some time now so
I'm finally making it for you guys and this video is just going to be
explaining my experiences with it growing up at least doing the pillow
thing again there is going to be a second part to this video I'm going to
be uploading a video to my beauty channel or my main channel so i will
leave the link to that down below
once it's up which will probably be in about a day or two so look forward to
that and also i just want to make a quick disclaimer i know a lot of the
times and if people make videos about anxiety or depression or both or having
either
it's very common now that people will comment saying that people are faking
anxiety that they're just doing it because it's trendy what my many people
might not know is that being someone's ID you tend to cancel a lot of like
things that involve leaving your house and I know personally for me and just
even from watching other people's stories that that is usually what ended
up leading me and a couple other people to doing things like you to so that
might be why it seems like a lot of youtubers have anxiety and depression
and such so something that I would never joke about because I don't wish it on my
worst enemy is so yeah i'm just going to jump in with my story and explain to you
guys just my own experience with it through life
I didn't really know that I had bad anxiety until about grade 12 high school
but I realized once I figured out or was diagnosed that that was what i was
struggling with for many years before I was ever diagnosed and just didn't know
what I remember in high school it would be like two or three times a week that i
would just toss and turn not being able to sleep because i couldn't shut my mind
off and um I was like sweat and get worried and anxious and have panic
attacks on the panic attacks i would say didn't really start until like later on
in high school like more so great eleven and twelve and that was when i started
to be like okay like there's something seriously wrong here
and I need to figure out what it is so long story short I spend a lot of time
in high school
making plans and canceling them um kind of distancing myself for isolating
myself into my bedroom and not really leaving
I trying to do things just for myself to make me feel better and then when people
would find out about them such as i remember i started to try tried to start
a YouTube back in high school and that was kind of like my little release and
then people from high school had found it back then and it was made fun of so i
deleted it and then I fell into an even worse like like depression type of thing
so I don't know it was very on and off and I was always looking for some type
of creative release that I could focus on and it would help and it did help but
a lot of the time I was too ashamed to share what it was that I was doing
whether it be sketching writing journaling youtubing I didn't like to
share those things because in turn I was made fun of and yeah so there was a ski
trip in my final year of high school and when I went on the ski trip when we were
out I had my phone stolen and i had just saved up enough money to buy the iphone
for it had just came out I had it for about three days and it was stolen from
me and I know this sounds silly to kind of have a panic attack about something
being stolen
but it wasn't so much that the thing was stolen it was just the anxiety and panic
that came with not being able to find where this phone wise
I was out of my hometown I what didn't know where I was it was night time it
was freezing cold it was in the middle of winter
I couldn't find people at first it was just it was a whole fiasco
so what ended up happening I couldn't find my phone i was running around
frantically everywhere I've been up until the last time I remember seeing my
phone and that was when the panic started to set in
I kept on not being able to find it i started to freak out i was running
around nobody can stop me or call me down and then I just dropped and started
to like hyperventilates so that was like my first really really really bad
experience with panic attacks i mean i had had anxiety / panic attacks before
where it would just be like at home
I would just suddenly start to kind of not being able to breathe and then
and it would feel like something was sitting on my chest and I would have to
like kind of like lay down and curl up into a fetal position trying to catch my
air and just not being able to but this one was like I was like gasping for air
and so that really scared me
so when I have gotten home from the ski trip i booked a doctor's appointment and
went into my doctor and told him everything and that i didn't realize at
this point what it was I just told him that I was freaking out constantly felt
inches and then at that point in my life
it was like being society was an all-day everyday type thing it was just like a
constant weight that I could just feel like almost like squeezing my heart or
like my lungs and it was just always liked pushing into my chest and I
couldn't like like I just felt like I couldn't breathe and my mind wouldn't
shut off and i would be shaking sometimes with the day and I would just
obsessively worry about things that we're gonna happen and it was just
really
it drains you it was so tiring and all on top of that i was trying to go to
school and get my schooling done at home then on top of that my parents ended up
splitting right around the same time and on top of that like it was just a lot
going on at once and i was diagnosed with anxiety
my doctor at the time so he wanted me to try some natural remedies and sent me to
do things like meditation and yoga and just gave me just here child these
things so I was already a runner in high school I always enjoyed running but at
this point I wasn't running as much as I had growing up so I wasn't doing much
exercise at the time and I tried to do yoga but yoga was expensive for someone
my age and I didn't realize that you could do it at home yet so nothing was
really working for me but on long story short I ended up going a whole other
year dealing with it without asking my doctor for more help
I'm another part of my anxiety which I didn't realize again was part of my
anxiety was i would get anxious even about calling and making a doctor's
appointment I don't know why but knowing I had to pick up a phone and call a
business and make an appointment and force myself to be like to go there at
that exact time like it was the thought of scheduling something that I guess
freaked me out i don't know why so I just kept on postponing it and
procrastinating and
I would procrastinate all the biggest things that were stressing me out
I just keep putting them off and putting them off and putting them off and on
again was another part of my anxiety because the thought of even having to do
those things that make me feel so anxious that would just be like I can't
talk about it i can think about it just don't even just push it off to the side
and don't pretend it even exists right now so that was something I struggle
this for a while so fast forward a little bit
I moved away to college and I decided to go to college very last minute moves
away a couple of like four hours away from my home and my anxiety was like
worse and better at the same time in a weird weird way better in the sense that
I'm someone that I actually really do enjoy my independence so I mean living
on my own and getting my own groceries and getting around the town by myself
like on a bus and something that I really enjoyed that
but at the same time my anxiety was still really bad like i would have
really really bad panic attacks in college and not only that this is where
i had probably one of my biggest drops in like depression i would say
looking back now I can see that I suffered on and on with depression for
pretty much as long as I can remember I can even remember being a kid and there
would just be certain times where I would feel really low and then it would
just go away and I didn't really think much of it as a kid because i was kid so
it's probably thought I was just kind of feeling gloomy for a couple days and
especially i would say in high school I would fall into ruts for about like two
months where I would just kind of not really hang out with my friends and I
mean I would see them and talk to them at school but i would just kind of wake
up go to school do my thing
go home not really trying to reach out to talk to anybody so that kind of went
on on and off on and off and i found it was especially worse in the winter and
then again so fast forward to college
I fell into a really really bad right where I like couldn't sleep at all and i
would stay up really really late tossing and turning and like just crying for no
reason and
it was like it's not scary it's just really sad because if any of you guys
suffer from depression you would know that when you're in those faces you
aren't yourself with you don't feel even the littlest bit like yourself you'll
have thoughts that scare you like you'll think of something and then you'll be
like I can't believe i just thought that like things where I would just be like I
just don't care
I just don't care if I wake up tomorrow whatever if I don't whatever like that's
how scary it was it wasn't that I was necessarily suicidal but it was like I
would go through phases where I'd be like uh I don't really care if I wake up
tomorrow
I went to a lot of faces especially around the time that I was away at
college where I just felt really lost didn't really care what happened
I don't know I just felt so out of my element so not myself and so like kind
of numb to everything in a weird way I decided to come home from college and it
wasn't even necessarily the fact that i was away from family and stuff i think
it was just it was a huge self evaluation because I went to college for
all the wrong reasons
it wasn't for me it wasn't what I'm not really wanted with my life so I moved
home when I moved home
my anxiety again got really really bad and I started to have like like panic
attacks i would say like every other day
so eventually I was like I can't do this anymore I need to get on medication so I
went back to my doctor finally and went on medication medication
I started to research while on it and I had seen a bunch of things where if you
go on anxiety / depression medication you may have to be on it for life
because your medication itself is creating serotonin in your brain and
serotonin is what is responsible for keeping your happy levels up and your
anxiety levels down so
serotonin is a good thing for your brain and a lot of people that have like
severe depression or anxiety it's actually because their brain just
doesn't create as much serotonin as the average brain which is why it's actually
not your fault that you are that way you could have just been genetically born
that way which is like myself but by the way I'm sorry if this is all over the
place guys I'm not really playing this out I'm just kind of going as I remember
so I got medication and at first I found that it was helping but I didn't really
like the way it made me feel I was real
be tired a lot I would just feel so like glue
I don't even have effort to go up and go to the washroom right now like I'm so
tired
not only that it made the panic attacks like decrease but when I would have a
panic attack it would be like severe so I decided I didn't want to medication
and decided to try some natural ways since then my anxiety has come in and
out of my life it's not an easy thing to live with anxiety and I mean if you are
someone that struggles
I really do recommend you seek help from your doctor seek help from your friends
seek help from your family at teachers someone you trust
but I decided for myself personally that I didn't want to go on medication
anymore so I've been doing natural remedies so I just started to exercise
more
get more into eating healthy I changed my lifestyle into a vegan right
lifestyle I was already vegetarian growing up and I decided to go vegan
that I find helped me a lot
um and doing things like meditation and yoga
so those are the biggest things that help me alongside planning and my
journal
if I keep myself ahead of the game on my schedule keep in doing exercise eating
healthy and meditation and yoga reading and always setting aside some downtime
for just myself just to kind of whether it's 15 minutes reading listening to
music or just just stuff that it's like nobody
it's just me and I'm just doing something because I just want to do it
at that moment and I enjoy it and that really helps me to ask her depression i
still go in and out of really bad rats - I actually went through one not too long
ago it was probably just after Christmas which again doesn't surprise me because
it always seems to happen the worst in the winter
I got into these really weird moods and the scary thing is I can feel them
coming on
I can feel this little gray clouds starting to follow me everywhere and i
even said to ryan after the like the most recent what I was saying to ride
back and feel comin I can feel it coming and sometimes when I can feel it coming
i can do some things to counteract it and push it off and get it away but
other times no matter what i do it still happens and that was this time so i
could feel it coming on and I just kind of went boom
I don't even know how to explain it it's just all the sudden you have 0
motivation to do anything you don't see the point in anything you lose a lot of
hope you become very very very pessimistic everything I see is negative
and I just can't see the positive anymore
there are times where I'll even wake up and I'm like I can't even film today
because i just have 0 motivation all i want to do is lay in bed or lay on my
couch and just not do anything I don't want to get ready i don't want to leave
my house I don't like I will literally isolate myself and it just gets worse
when you do that but you can't help it because you have no motivation to help
yourself that's the worst part
luckily for me um after a while when i go into my weird like d down-and-out
depression phases I'll go through this like random thing will be like you know
what no I can't do this to myself anymore i'm not going to give in and
I'll start to force myself out of it but that's kind of lucky because I I know
there's a lot of people falling into a depression for a very very long time
I haven't gone and explain to this part Foley to my doctor but like it's why I i
say i don't suffer fully from depression i suffer on and off because i can bring
myself out of it and sometimes I can stay out of it for a couple months out
of the time but every now and then I'll fall in back into like this weird right
or depression for about a month or sometimes two months
you literally have thoughts are you just be like the world is just too
overwhelming and I just don't care if i wake up and that's a scary thing to
think because i remember even thinking that and not being like wow I can't
believe i just thought that that's scary but you don't you don't you want
yourself you don't perceive it when you're thinking that you're just
thinking it because that's how crazy you feel like it's it's a scary thing
because having a mental illness
it's your brain going against you it's you against yourself and there's nothing
more terrifying / exhausting than fighting yourself like all day every day
with anxiety and depression like I would always be fighting with myself I would
have this negative thought that would be like you don't want to do anything today
the world sucks everything sucks and then i would try and fight that thought
with a positive thoughts on my whole brain would just be fighting with itself
it's
it's so hard for me to explain and i feel like i might just be all over the
place and I feel like I'm missing a lot out of my story but it's just I don't
know how else to explain it other than it's a good an exhausting battle of you
against yourself hard not to feel hopeless about it sometimes when you
know every time I get out of a depression i can't help but have that
little side thought that's like oh I feel great now but we all know i'm going
to fall back into one so it's like an ongoing cycle that I can't escape that
can cause you to become very hopeless about it and it can cause you to become
very pessimistic about it and even when you do feel good you're like oh i know
i'm going to feel bad soon so luckily i'm here i'm making this video for you
guys right now and I can easily say that the reason why I'm deciding to do this
video now as opposed to earlier
it's because I'm in a really good phase in my life right now with my anxiety and
my depression
it's easier for me to talk about it when I'm in a really good place in my life
because when i'm in a dark place I don't really want to talk about it because it
brings me down more a and B when i'm in a dark place it's hard for me to talk
about it without being pessimistic about it or negative about it
I know that's a more personal or more negative side to me than you guys have
really ever seen
I try and keep a lot of my content really really positive because i don't
want to drain you guys of your energy but I feel like if this video can help
anybody that's a positive thing to look at and also I can sit here and tell you
that I don't think I've ever been this happy in my life and I don't think I've
ever been this anxiety free in as long as i can remember you know i i've come
to terms and accepted the fact that i think i'm going to suffer from things
like anxiety and depression for the rest of my life I think I'll come in and out
of any all have good days and then I'll have bad days but i also have accepted
the fact that i'm ready to deal with that said I don't want to make anybody
question whether or not they should get on medication or not
everybody's journey everybody's pass everybody's story is very different i
highly recommend that you please don't try and fix it by yourself
the reason why I'm deciding to try a
do it the natural way is because AI have such a good support team
I have ryan i have my family I have my clothes close friends that I talk to
about it and I have been linked as silly as that sounds
bentley helps a lot so I mean all of that combined with the fact that i've
been really getting into meditation and positive thinking and just like
unleashing that this whole like part of your brain that can cause you to live
like very positively for the rest of your life
that is what's kept me off of medication and wanted to try it this way as long as
I can
if it did get to a point that it got a lot worse or I started to feel suicidal
or anything like that
if I never came to me concerned or my family ever came to me concerned i would
definitely consider going back on medication but amount of phase in my
life where I'm feeling very comfortable dealing if it the way that I am dealing
with it and trying to go about it in a more natural way
so please if you're dealing with any of these things at least talk to somebody
or seek help from a doctor a parent a friend a family member a teacher anybody
if you guys are dealing with something like this please at least talk to
somebody about it
don't just try and deal with it by yourself I'm really sorry if I missed
anything or like offended anybody or like I don't know if there's anything
you guys think I may have missed or not touched on or maybe like touched on but
didn't do it in the correct way just go ahead and leave it down below because i
know this is such a serious topic that I don't want to offend anybody and I don't
want to get anybody some misinformation or the wrong perception or the wrong
interpretation
so please please if I miss anything or you guys have a different view or if
there's anything that i should elaborate on please please comment down below
because i don't want to get anybody the wrong type of information and I just
want you guys watching this
even if you don't suffer from anxiety depression even if you're just going
through a rough time in your life where you've gone through rough times in your
life there's always hope there's always going to be hope there's always
something you can try and you're never ever alone
I also want to say that I'm not somebody that's saying medication is bad if you
need to get on anxiety medication or antidepressants then please do talk
about it make a plan with your doctor and make a plan with your family make a
plan
with yourself even to just help yourself just make some sort of plan no matter
what it is and just don't deal with it by yourself and don't allow it to take
over your life because that's when you let it win and you don't want to let it
win so yeah I hope this gave you guys a better understanding of just the ins and
outs of my own personal struggle with things like anxiety and depression and
