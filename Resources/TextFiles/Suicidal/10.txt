it's a period and today I'm bringing you another video this is gonna be difficult
to make
I think it's only fair to talk about it the kind of explain to some people who
were concerned over social media about what happened and stuff like that and
just kind of get it off my chest and to just put it out there
yeah huge
awarding right here baby talking about suicide and depression and so far
probably and like stuff containing to that just mental stuff in general so if
you're cruising you and your dog and a good night to watch this and hear about
those kind of things click off its is honestly not that important
yeah so
you can tell from the title of the video I tended to the side and I actually just
got out of the hospital now and still so there's so much building up and I mean I
can't explain everything that was going on but I can just say that there was a
lot of noise in my head down too much it was extremely overwhelming
I guess I wanted to end the debate on what I was going to kill myself or not
and I wanted to stop just like I'm just keep trying to keep saying I'm going to
recuperate but it happens like I was like I just wanted over way secret going
cycle
you know
side attempting suicide in our working people getting worried what you doing
carry people caring people just judging
bad because I can even kill myself and I'm like you know I have lived with this
fainter to mom
and I felt it was my only option
didn't want to reach out and that didn't help because I haven't gotten hope for
just a brief stop before the day truman
I've been in the hospital six times I've seen so many Thursday night to help with
their but it wasn't enough help they just I can never be hoped everything was
she so hopeless you know so I started collecting hills the city we have
because we have had to put everything in a safe since November when I overdosed
and I do loss but we have the same full of late nights and medication lighters
and matches and stuff so I can't get to it
my parents and I'm not blaming memory they just didn't think anything of it
was fine so they just love this a lot and they probably don't even need to
they probably were just probably just gonna come back and lock it again
probably just forgot and I saw like I had my eyes on the same click the minute
that things open in the me I could find a key which I did find a key point I'm
gonna get it just slowly gradually added pills and I slowly he collected them
kept them in my room and it's over a month before I don't plan to do anything
but I needed them there and I felt so securely with them
ok because it's like if I was really really impulsive one day or just out of
my head I have some things you know and I don't want to give it up
and it won't tell anyone even though sometimes I really didn't really want to
stop a couple of weeks went on and I'm like ok I'm probably just gonna make a
plan to make a plan to go to my school and get a big drink from sunlight and go
in the bathroom so for us and just kind of hurt by extremely selfish extremely
terrible but I talked about it was hurting you know and yes no ok this week
I'm gonna go to school
first day back saying goodbyes so I said goodbye and first person to say goodbye
to the only person to say goodbye to the council to the school and being so I
just kind of used to say goodbye
like on to say goodbye because you know it might not be coming back to school
for the year
you automatically became worried because my past and stuff and no suicide or not
I'm just trying to figure out what to do with school I is I'm probably just not
gonna come back and this really behind her well in the CNN school year anyway
so I caused by my counselor counselor and talk to me assure you this i'll you
reach out and then mice principal and there's officers and he is like a
suicide note we just have to take these measures you know what you say is very
concerning and how to say it is very concerned I'm not sure I want to class
and then they called my mom and dad actually my parents to help their phones
on the top of the school should call them tell them what I have been saying
the police went out to my house and called my mom school and her principal
she's embarrassing and stuff like that so everyone was kind of something wrong
but I convinced everyone everything's fine the next day I went into the
bathroom and I started taking posted a suicide note on Facebook I so wanted to
be public
I posted this on to say no and they just right after that I just taking time and
I looked at the poolside help left mike is gonna be tough to put me in the
hospital with severe problems so much better stop you know I may stop by to
any more serious didn't problem which is disappointing
I guess I don't want to come to the point where the safe was in the car and
put into my cunt gallery or pills so I didn't have enough to do what I wanted
it so I went today told my school counselor
she's like well you know we gotta call 911 Mike probably do
so I was putting
future
sent to psychiatric hospital days
kind of sick
i mean
so hard so hard
but
I didn't accept
people wanted me to talk
I said
my family I did times in six days
struggling so much
and so was in there are more than you think
just talk
to self-harm just talking to you
safe place everything's taken away from me reading 20 workers
but
you know it's just not just
because you know
my story
that's kind of what happened
I just want to say to me on Facebook and stuff
I wish I had some sort of it's not worth living life like this somewhere getting
attached to a hospital environment they're attached the idea that you just
want to die and touched it no matter how they make you feel in a matter you know
your server felt was damn hospital in the past I just it's sure everything's
hold me back from getting myself better and really everything is fine
sides I'm here to tell you it's really not working and I regret that I did
goes
I don't know
yes thanks for letting me get my story out there
you know
citizens but it's like you know going into hospital you know it's actually
power to you see kids didn't do some really shitty things like you have just
don't really know I only you're going to see a you know when you're not the only
one who's got a bad helps to know because it's like is not to say that I
like this so great because obviously it's not his only compared life is worse
just knowing that your company you got people giving people in this world who
can be genuinely genuine to you generally care of genuine will you
support my nurse was quite a few times and you know he's working in ICU
patients were mostly with kids I mean I guess it's just like your experiences
and power to do about your experience and help others because that's what I've
been told in the hospital is like your views as soon as I can go Ronnie support
people how people can make your YouTube general ben-ami I mean this is when I
get issues and I never take for granted I feel like I did when I try to
my life because I wasn't thinking of people behind so listening to that and
the next one
