good my life everyone around me my friends my family my teachers they always told me this one word think before you do anything but is one what actually caused me more harm than anything else then I came across distort 
and I soon realise additional was actually helping meet what I want to do someone to guide my story into reality stewards of really helped me shape my life when I was in school I should think before I would raise my hand to us if you get a question I would think before answering questions imho and what I would think before doing anything and in the process idea not bring anything at all but then into it in lemon scented I became extremely fascinated by the concept of filmmaking the fact that you can take a small little handicap and enjoy the rest of the world what's inside your head I too that's a very very powerful medium identifies could have it up to my mom and a best friend unwanted all these seem to take an active interest in my life I do them out I want to be a filmmaker 
I don't even very impressed 
because they are in India if you want to be anything other than an engineer or doctor you're considered a dentist the OVC said no but the sad thing was a meeting to this maybe I won't be successful filmmaker maybe I will make enough money maybe I won't make it this one word got me to a lot of trouble because it got me to this 
not now that I have anything against engineering but I hated it every minute every second of it 
but 
a something happen engineering a bottle and I was an above average student I'd I'd never fear 
but for the first time in my life I feel and that one moment of freedom actually don't out to be a very strong woman to success for me 
from then on 
I have to prove anything to anyone anymore 
except myself 
so I decided to do this 
sort of a man to come again as I shooting Amish orphans and sighed uploading them and then two thousand and six is why little invention comes along you know lets you upload audio video is at a click of a button and asked what can see 
imagine at that moment sigh side of putting all my films in an aside to make even more films 
some people start noticing it and decidedly profession look so with the help of you did not come into force you have got to set up my first company blossom infants because engineering everything is on at the last minute and I soon realized that in the real whatever things on the last minute to 
are you Anita distraught Ben god Pentagon they asked me to direct a music video for them and that is only going to be for you do you 
so I made a music video and it ended up getting a hundred thousand views and up this production company in Bombay so the video and they offered me a job direct 
so you know I was getting a Johns not doing this is not to be a global but to start directing music videos 
but I was in the target of my college 
so from Bombay I called my mom %HESITATION and under warranty obviously and doing that you know I'm getting a chance to do that always you do and what impressed me twenty years old sitting in vomit nothing added up right so I had to come back and finish one long torturous out of internet 
once I was finally done with my engineering I cited that this is what I'm going to do so I took a one way bus ticket to Bombay I landed up debt 
and I went up to the production companies office hoping that they'll have a job for me and surprisingly they did I not do months later I you know I this and me too Mr Amman studio to detect small promo video I was shit scared because all they knew 
analysis and 
continue what I was going to do that 
Mr them on and you know in a forward to 
but they should mental well thankfully but at the end of the video he told me was that you know I don't like is very short always do what you love and always do what you believe in 
I get does what's for the rest of my life a couple of months lead objecting a music video for Shankara's envoy Donald music we did was one of India's biggest actresses because into and she refused to believe over the director I was twenty years old and I look fifteen and she definitely didn't bite and you can see from the picture he deftly doesn't look happy with you janitor Jack but I predicted this video I realize that you know I do you want to do something on my own so I came back Dibango and that's been accidentally second part of my life started and it sounded to me like this somebody loaded because that is a bombing a drunk because you don't have no inhibitions I think anything is possible to me my family sitting in this bar and getting drunk in the sun isn't done beside him is a highschool so be possible to school god bishop gardens and we're going to Dorian's 
so we like you know what we she gets what you had to do what to do and I didn't 
but we were drunk I tell anything is possible to elect dude I don't diss for every school in college in this country 
sort of pushed piece of tissue people we do it on a book and business plan to make merchandise for students of every school in college in this country 
okay so now that we have an idea and had this nobody going to we're not going to go to mommy anointing dilemma either because you only know what happened that night so we're not going to do this but the problem was that we don't know anything about running a business nothing 
absolutely nothing 
so this is what we supposed to do but for use of engineering and they never thought Microsoft excel I idealize that that's the only thing needed mn 
that was something about the 
so and all this is about the lot of bone before night this is what we're going to do so be funded by affecting friend in this modern to boot any offer to make a some samples 
we landed up at the older boys DO bishop gardens with us more distraught and hope that people would be interested adverse nobody showed up but then this one kid humanos as you know where to get this hoodie from I can about it and and he said yeah you can and then you got benefits other could learn in friends and they got Benavidez underfunded have decided ended up selling two thousand five and hoodies 
so that's when we knew that yes we have something and I 
and the good thing was when these could only get started reading the audience out and moving on down 
students from other schools angle is going to kill us if there were like that you get that from 
and that is our intention so we knew that they going to come to us but then we knew that if you're going to do this in for the entire country to go to figure out a plan 
so in two thousand nine be officially launched on model as an online store to cater to students at schools and colleges across India but the moment we started that's when all the problems started my friends like to what's wrong with you while you're doing this you know just get a regular job by taking such a big risk 
my mom was delighted because she thought I won't get any doubt in India if we don't look for interesting not get out 
my moment 
and I'm going to go and get the shit salesman 
all of this like Billy Sunday playing with my head and I became really insecure and I was like 
what am I doing what am I doing 
and then I just went back to that once one moment of engineering that I feel 
and I thought 
you know I feel in engineering and not nothing bad happened 
if I feel in this was the worst 
so we decided to give it a shot and soon enough things began to change we started growing people started noticing us 
they put us on the cover of India's biggest magazine they look more than fifty newspaper articles around us 
and this is that I'm a lot is pretty unusual 
let us to a different cities with or for like students all out of sitting out of that one small office in Bangor 
but 
we just thought about it 
exactly a year later my friend and I was sitting in the samba and is it random Kate walks past us wedding adorning hoodie mind that one moment I think that one woman to success for me success is not money is not god or is not a bank balance 
it's moments like these 
you know the moment we saw that invoked buses and exactly are you related we just look at us we don't see anything so for me that was my kid eat is Canada's moon to success and that success given because of 
do you think 
so in in the meantime we kept we get last minute things running obviously and we ended up up with over a million views on on a you've got it and the best models you made as a partner so finally them send me mail at seeing that now every time anyone sees a videos would be you I thought that was really awesome because my dad was divided by uploading ledges videos but the moment he he can bring that I get paid for it now he was like you should applaud as many videos as you get dnmt 
still not going to be interesting part of this story this unwanted got it that I choose always a reason strong part of my life she's that character who always you know button was in in all all all of my activities 
so to figure out you know how to how to deal with the situation 
so I said I said a lot of notes on on Facebook and dogs about on one day and you know 
could you tell them about what you know how he damaging my life and somebody said you know 
you should read a book about it 
the problem was that fifty thousand words in a book the most number of whatever it is five hundred words 
so I think how did a book but I remember my English teacher once told me everything look stuff until you actually go ahead and do it sigh I started and I never stop and actually looked sixty thousand words and I heard a book on it however be venue Andean group on a million dollar company female business adversity unwanted into a brand ambassador 
and I 
because the book was about how he cited annoyed and unlucky became the famous 
so Yoshi was going around telling everything against us and now she was famous you can see anything up against us anymore 
but the most interesting thing about the book was we've bootstrapping right so we never had money to market a company so not somebody else's marketing accompanying being us you could bid for marketing I never thought of the concept like this could exist I only I don't you know that you have to be a lot of marketing but is also we've at someone asking for you to market your very own company I knew that the book was doing really really bad because it's a lot of copies but the most interesting thing was when I walked into an auto and the other guy was selling my book and I took this bridge and I sent it on to Andi and she scented oil of friends because bodies who's this was a high point dnmt some girl in my dog with this model story since it is all about story it's it's about two gentleman Mister that it invested a shock 
some red blooded underpin any doing the story 
they both went to ID in the nineteen eighties then they went to Harvard Business School I show went on to work for apple that went on to work for a big %HESITATION consulting firm allegedly sneaking under indefinite business meeting his car broke down in Calcutta and they do come to this garage 
and he funded the guy was a betting the guy was a shock 
that it was shot you like Chicago to be debating the guy who the smartest get Ivan you people should probably just the CEO of some company 
then I should go to Mr Ortiz that you know what a game I work for apple for it for a few yards and I came back to India media company that increased fuel efficiency so that and then started his get out because all I really love to visit bedding because of my very own hands 
that it was the one dealing with the story 
I don't even I'm sixty five years old on the vice president of my company my only regret in life is that I don't live live a life that I wanted to live 
I lived a life that somebody else wanted me to live 
I only do anyways 
don't give up on your dreams 
and for me to do that I think 
don't think just do fangs nnj
