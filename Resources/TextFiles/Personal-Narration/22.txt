so what's the deal
fairy tail and a war story a fairy tale begins once upon a time a war story
starts
no shit there I was
no shit there i was barreling down this mountain bike to send yourself
salida colorado it was one of those two cents where there's a whole lot of
descent and not a lot of trail so i was really focusing on just staying on the
trail and at some point in that ride there was no me no bike
not even a trail there just was
that's the best way I can describe it it was effortless it was selfless it was
immensely joyful I wasn't there yet
there I was in one of the most awesome events of my life when my sense of self
came back online
it looked back on the trail and say wow what was that when can I do that again
this was flow I was in the flow state and it was delicious
now we've all been in flow at some point in our lives
maybe we're playing sports playing or listening to music or even getting
really immersed in a project let's say you get really immersed in a project you
look up
it's five hours later it's dark outside your bladder is about to explode because
you've been so focused on what you've been doing now
if this is so great why don't we do this all the time
the answer we get in our own way
here's an example remember lolo jones an American hurdler favored to win the 2008
beijing olympics
what do you remember she was in the lead at the 9th of 10 hurdles and then what
happened
in an interview with Time magazine she said I was just in this amazing rhythm
and at some point I knew I was winning the race
it wasn't like oh I'm winning the Olympic gold medal it just seemed like
another race and then I started telling myself to make sure my legs were
snapping out so I over tried
that's when I hit the hurdle instead of letting herself
do what she had trained to do she got in her own way she tripped herself up
literally she tripped on the 9th of 10 hurdles and finished seven
now this is an important point here it's not that she was thinking it's that she
got caught up in thinking as she said I over try
so how often do you think we get in our own way
if this is any indication there was a study at Harvard that found that fifty
percent of the time we get caught up in regretting things from the past worrying
about what we're going to do in the future
fifty percent of the time even when we're daydreaming about that perfect
Hawaiian vacation or no happier than when we're in the present moment they
concluded that a wandering mind is an unhappy mind I'd amend this - dude get
out of your own way flow is awesome and it doesn't show up on drug tests
so as low in these Harvard researchers are showing us getting caught up in
self-referential thinking can get us in our own way
are there other ways that we can do this as well well I'm an addiction
psychiatrist at Yale and my lab is looking at ways to help people quit
smoking
so what's a craving like cravings are great right
what's up craving really feel like I just think of that extra scoop of ice
cream you wanted to have when you're on a diet or maybe that car that was just
outside of your price range
what does this really feel like you think about it we get all restless and
square me we break out into a sweat
this isn't graded socks I had a smoker tell me that his cravings were so strong
he felt like his head would explode if you didn't smoke solo gets in her own
way by getting caught up in thinking these things getting the wrong way by
getting caught up in or resisting cravings see the trend here getting
caught up in resisting flow is just being with all of this stuff so we
taught smokers mindfulness how to really pay attention and just be with their
cravings and what did they learn the first thing they learned was these were
just body sensations that we're driving their lives
the next thing they learned was they could let these things come up
do their dance and go away they didn't have to get sucked in by him they didn't
have to resist them and their heads didn't explode and they quit smoking
in fact in a randomized controlled trial
we found that this training was twice as good as the gold standard twice as good
just by getting out of your own
way we're taking this to the next level by using the exact technology that's
distracting us from the present moment to help smokers stay in the present
that's right
I phones we can actually deliver this using videos and animation we can even
give people in dville exercises to help them really write out their cravings the
moment they come up
we also want to see what's going on in people's brains when they're getting out
of their own way
so here we brought in experienced meditators folks who are really good at
just being to see what their brains would look like when they were
meditating
so just to orient do here's the brain and here's a brain when you cut it down
the middle - all the blood and guts and here's a network of rid of brain regions
called the default mode Network
how do you think it got its name remember that fifty percent of the time
when we're not present in fact mark rakel and his colleagues at washington
university in st. louis serendipitously discovered this by giving people the
simple task
laying the scanner and don't do anything in particular so what do we do when we
don't do anything in particular
can you relate well it turns out that experienced meditators these brain
regions in the default mode Network get really quiet when they're meditating and
this back part of the brain called the posterior cingulate this part that gets
activated when we're craving it gets activated when we're anxious when we're
getting in our own way
it's especially quiet during meditation so what can we learn from this
well I know Hollywood might give you a particular idea of what we scientists
are like but we're actually pretty reserved and we get really conservative
when it comes to finding something new
how do we know our stuffs any good maybe we missed something
so we turned to a new technique called real-time fmri neurofeedback where we
can actually take a picture of people's brains while they're meditating and see
what it looks like from moment to moment to moment so we did this with novice and
experienced meditators and we just have them laying the skin or meditate with
their eyes open and then check in
the graph to see how well their brain activity was corresponding to their
experience and they all reported a very good correspondence with increased
activity in this posterior cingulate and getting in their own way as well as
decreased activity and being in a meditative state
so here's the next example of a novice meditator here's an example of an
experienced meditator now I'm not very good at statistics but even I can tell
the difference between these two brains further some of our experienced
meditators were reporting spontaneously getting into flow during these sessions
and seeing that this lineup with their posterior cingulate is getting really
really quiet
but wait there's more some of our novices were actually learning from this
even though we weren't telling them to
here's an example this novice said yes the first one lined up with my
experience second run lined up with my experience and then the third one he
said wait a minute you're neurofeedback thing doesn't work I'm that thing was
all read the graph was all red but i was thinking about my breath
what's the problem here they came about my breath he got caught up in thinking
in the very next run
only nine minutes after starting this experiment his brain looks completely
different
and he said oh I get it the physical sensation of the breath
Oh in just nine minutes
he learned the difference between getting caught up and getting out of his
own way not to say that he is now a Buddha or can dunk on Michael Jordan but
perhaps you got a taste of flow and just like my brain at the bottom of that
mountain bike descent he came out of that scanner and said wow what was that
when can I do it again
reality is so much more delicious than our concepts of it and if we can track
it
we can train it we can start to use what we're learning from this neuroscience to
develop tools to help people learn and really see what it's like to get in
their own way and get out into the flow of life
so just to sum it up here as our dear novice meditators showed us
this flow business is tricky business
we all can taste flow at moments of our lives but how can we learn to get into
it more and more and more
what we can learn from lolo and are smokers we can really start to pay
attention
what's it like when we get caught up in thinking with how is this different than
just noticing thoughts come up
what's it like when we get caught up in a craving or a resisting some experience
what's this like compared to just noticing these body sensations come up
that are trying to tell us to do things and just being with them and also
perhaps we can add a little bit of neurofeedback to help people practice
this better as Vince Lombardi said practice doesn't make perfect perfect
practice makes perfect
when we get out of our own way we're happier or more engaged with the world
were more compassionate and as a result we can perform at our best
we all are awesome we just have to get out of our own way
thank you
