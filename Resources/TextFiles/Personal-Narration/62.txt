walking down the hall laughing a little too loud and acting maybe a little too
crazy would be some of the things that people would use to describe me
my name is Jamie silver and I'm in junior out holdrege high school and I'm
16 years old I hope that after i get through telling you a little bit about
myself my family and my goals in life you'll know exactly why people describe
me that way
many may say my name as though i'm a little bit of a handful and I guess you
could say that but I guess that's why we have family to understand goddess to
life
I'm a very blessed eid girl because i have a lot of family my mother's name is
and she's a bookkeeper at the holder to Memorial homes and she's worked very
hard to raise my older sister Amy my younger brother Cole and myself two
wonderful kids we are get my dad's name is Jim silver and he's been farming his
whole entire life I wouldn't trade him for the road and he's the best father I
could ask for
sadly though my parents are divorced like many others but I have gained two
amazing step parents and some amazing step-siblings my stepfather's name is
shannon watts and he works for the pipeline that goes across America he's
always shooting me as his own and he's an amazing second father my stepmothers
name is sherry silver sheet was also an amazing mother she works from the home
and she's gifted us with three other three older other sisters and one older
brother my three sisters consists of April who's the oldest another Jamie and
Ashley was very excited just to have younger sibling of her own
I have an older stepbrother his name is dylan and he and I are very close
because we are very close in age so we get along grade
many would think that this is a burden to have as many people in your family
but I wouldn't trade it for the world
I love having all the love and support i do my family is a little bit weird
compared to most families that are in my situation my family gets along great and
my mom and dad practically never fight i love having it to families because i
know that many kids don't even have the luxury of having one complete one so I
know that I'm very blessed to have families that will help me guide be
guided through life my family has taught me a lot about myself and about life
they have shaped and influenced my life and hobbies have tons of things going on
in the year as this any typical highschool girl I'm a die-hard athlete
and I play volleyball club volleyball tennis in the summer i also play
softball
i'm also the co-captain of our high school cheerleading squad and my church
is a huge part of my life i am a youth leader at our church which means that i
helped and attend to the younger kids and just kind of show them how they're
supposed to be acting I love being a role model for younger peers i am
involved in our local 4-h i am the president of our dog club in our horse
club i'm also a junior leader which there again means that i go around and I
tell the younger kids what they should be doing what they should be doing
I love being a role model for the other students when I do have free time I love
to sing
I'm in our high school's choir and our show choir and I attend voice lessons on
a regular basis and i love seeing at our church for my grandma
I try and show that show my family that I'm a little independent by trying to
make my own money i work in my fair ladies fashions which is a clothing
store here in town
my life is packed with many activities that will help me grow and learn as we
move towards you i would like to become in the future i have very high
expectations for myself and where I'd like to end up in life i have only two
more years of high
school left and I find myself freaking out a little and telling it to slow down
because i'm not sure what I want to do in the future
the ultimate goal i have after high school is to be completely reliant on
myself I don't want to have to rely on my parents the rest of my life I know
that that won't happen that won't happen unless I get a good education and
maintain goals and expectations that will help me to succeed
I've thought a lot about colleges and majors and I'm only just beginning to
figure out that you'll never be settled on just one you're going to change your
mind a million times as I have and I'm only a junior i would love to attend a
school in state and retain a communications major at the University
of Nebraska in Lincoln i would love to be in a sorority and have my life packed
with as many activities as I do right now in high school in 10 years I see
myself being very independent and working as a public representative for a
large company i would love to make sure people are interested and excited about
the new ideas that are presented to them i also would like to have a family
someday and teach my children about the opportunities to feel everyone's life
although my future is a little scary i know that i always have family support
me and I my activities guiding me i have described a lot about myself my family
and my future I hope you gained just a glimpse of how my life
