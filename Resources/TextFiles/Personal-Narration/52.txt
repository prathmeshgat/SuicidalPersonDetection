everyone I'm Jake torpey and this is my own personal experience speech when it
comes time in life when everyone's handed a choice
just keep going through the motions or make a change and move forward in a
positive manner
well prior to moving to Colorado had not been the happiest person I've failed out
of Duluth Minnesota because I party too much and skip classes
thinking I was a changed man after i moved back for a summer
I took a semester at mhcc you back then and did not do very well either
after that I decided to work full-time as a tile setter did that for a year
we also installed laminate vinyl tile flooring which is basically a fake would
look I was having a hard time realizing what it was I truly wanted to do in my
life in spring 2014 on vacation with three friends of mine to Colorado and I
instantly fell in love
the astonishing mountains crystal-clear Lakes incredible hiking trails and
breathtaking views
just name a few reasons why after returning from the application
immediately was time craig's list and all the job search websites looking for
any opportunity to get out there i was hooked and I just had to go back I found
a job in a little ski town of about breckenridge colorado big for
vacationers and young students to go out there in college applications and things
like that and the job was working as a roller coaster attendant
they set up on the mountain during the summer offered employee housing is
perfect
roller coaster is different from what you normally think of roller coaster is
basically you go up or tone up these metal tracks and
gravity takes you down a mountain you have a little hand bringing you want to
slow down so it's good for younger age children
it was a fun time for the time being but uh met some amazing people in this job
is a lot of young young students and just recent grads things like that and
it was a great experience but the job really wasn't for me and I'm quitting
and became a vacation around the house cleaner for a little bit but this is the
only job actually ever been fired from that's another story for a different day
set up being a from there i encountered the job that I would work out the last
year i remained in Colorado grand fabrication is not a glorious trade but
it's satisfying enjoyable work and it pays the bills
enjoy working with my hands and making things and after about eight months or
so though I just realized that my earning potential wasn't what I wanted
it to be with this type of work and unfortunately I just needed that piece
of paper from a college institution much as I enjoyed it
I learned the true value of a college education kind of so whether or not i
agree with the principles behind it
I still to this day have a hard time with the price of a college education
it's about being tackled by others in our society and it's not that much
change yet although there has been a big push lately and does show a lot of hope
it wasn't all work though actually most of the time out there was about finding
myself and rediscovering my passions sounds clich√© but sometimes you just
need to take a break from reality to kind of figure out who you truly are you
really want to be my first I was filled with skiing and hockey in the winter as
well as camping backpack
in the summers hiking on the most gorgeous most gorgeous trails I've ever
been places I've never thought I would see I vividly remember late nights
sitting out on the porch in the valley miles away from the nearest city
I mean the stars really never look quite as good just experiencing nature like
this is truly something i would recommend anyone who gets the
opportunity
well after that I moved back to Wisconsin for 18 months spent in
Colorado and I had a new motivation with me even after attorney and knowing that
a business finance degree from edgewood is what I desired the path wasn't as
easy as as I hoped it would be to get there
I applied initially and was turned down to the GPA that I received from Duluth
and the only may have just given up and went back to work but a new drive and I
chose to take many semesters as needed at Madison College to bring that GPA up
to but it was need necessary for requirements overjoyed after only one
semester to be able to applying it accepted to edgewood and last master was
my first master there in the spring here and I achieved the 4.1 made the Dean's
List and there was one of the most rewarding experience of my life is truly
satisfying and I tribute this success to have been realizing over the past year
to take a decision or make this decision to take a break from school and just
take some time off and find yourself to anyone uncertain about their future
I urge them to take a break go do something you never thought you'd do
learn something about yourself and the world around you experience new things
life's too short to try and mold yourself into something someone else
wants you to be which is what I initially had been trying
do I wasn't ready to go to college right away and I took me a year and a half and
quite a bit of money
quite a bit of money spent later to realize this but you know what is just
money
things are things so overjoyed that i finally have realized this and it's my
personal experience
