hello my name is unique rd and today I'll be giving you a little insight into
my life and this will include a little information about my background my
personality and some of my personal goals as well and hopefully by the end
of this presentation you'll learn a little about how much I care for my
friends and family many goals I've set for myself how much I enjoy counting and
also how I perceive myself and how I feel others perceive me as well i'm
currently a 19 year old student attending and thin and unlike most of
the class who are Florida natives i am originally from New York and care about
five years ago with my mom and moving here was rather difficult for me at the
time I did have to adjust to a lot of new changes especially being a high
school freshman my head to find a whole bunch of new friends i did lose a lot of
friends at the time with move so basically just need to this whole new
changes
thing very significant to me but Carly right now I am focused on work in school
I recently received the position at the sundial Beach and Golf Resort on Sanibel
and i'm very excited about this this is my first full-time position and I'm
excited to gain a lot from the experience i hope to graduate from
edison this January will next January coming up and from there i plan on
attending FGCU there's not a lot of interesting characteristics to my life I
would say I'm basically just driven by the goals I've set for myself on one of
these would be maintaining my new job I've actually included a list of the
different goals I've set for myself in my slideshow presentation if you'd like
to take a look at that as well other than maintaining my new job i also hope
to eventually graduate from school and hopefully we got on my own right now i
am working full-time but i am also a full-time student so eventually I do
hope to receive my bachelor's and maybe even master's degree in accounting
unlike some of the other students in our class my major is accounting
and although many people find it to be a very boring major I consider it to be
something very interesting i've always been interested in working with numbers
and money so I felt that this was a great opportunity to pursue and it's
also feel that allows you a lot of stability especially in our economy
everybody needs an accountant these days so you can always find a job in a
position like this and I've actually also included another slide that
portrays the different various incomes at different levels and counter scenes
and also the many different fields and careers you can pursue with an
accounting degree when it comes to how I view myself i consider myself to be a
very shy confident individual that time my friends and family would consider me
to be very funny in a little outgoing but when it comes to others who don't
know me my funny to be a little shy and awkward tongues even and the reason i
feel that this happens is because I am an only child I basically grew up by
myself and unlike most of the other students in our class after completing a
survey found that a lot of you guys do have at least one other sibling who are
close to them so unlike most of you guys I did grow up by myself and this is
probably why I tend to keep to myself and get a little awkward when it comes
to interacting with individuals but this is something that I hope eventually
change about myself and I eventually learned
to interact better and cooperate better overall my friends and family would
consider me to be a very caring individual
oh I don't get a chance to visit them very often i do try to go up there as
much as possible up north and the family and friends that you have close to me
here I would do anything for practically so I would consider myself to be very
caring individual as well this basically sums up a little about me
hopefully you've been able to learn a lot about my background my personality
and my different goals in life and although i may not tend to be very
interesting i do consider myself to be a hard-working and dedicated individual
and a very caring friend family member and these are traits that i'm proud to
share it have and ultimately i hope to achieve a lot in life
thank you for listening to my presentation and i hope to learn a lot
about the rest of the class as well thank you
