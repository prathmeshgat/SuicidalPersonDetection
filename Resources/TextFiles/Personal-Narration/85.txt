when i graduated from university
I didn't know what career I wanted to choose i had a lot of interests but
which interests should I pursue and try and turn into a job
so back then I was really interested in martial arts
here's me but I didn't want to turn that into a career
here's my face
I was really interested in and I was studying philosophy but one of the
Philosopher's I've most enjoyed reading late at night in my dorm room recently
said philosophy is a bunch of empty ideas and there's no jobs in philosophy
anyway so that was out being a slightly weird kid I was really interested in
investing and finance and even taken a portion of the small savings I had and
investment into gold when I was a teenager now I knew that following the
finance route would be a really well-paid career and but i was wondering
like maybe I wouldn't make as much difference as I could and that it
wouldn't help society
so in the end it wouldn't really be that fulfilling and so I was left with the
question how could I choose a fulfilling career and maybe many of you have asked
yourself the same question and I thought about this question i realized i didn't
even know how to go about choosing a career and I know read books
I went to careers advisers I just couldn't really find the information i
really needed
what would I be good at in the end what skills should I learn now which areas is
there a great social need where I could make a difference
these are unanswered questions led me to kind of delay the decision by a few
years instead of actually settling on a career i founded an organization
dedicated to researching the question of which career to choose and this
organization is called 80,000 hours
that's the number of hours you have in your working life that's a long time so
it's worth really doing some serious research and trying to work out how best
to use them
we help you do some of this research and we publish all of our findings as part
of a free online course guide to 80,000 hours dawg
his some of the team today surrounded by laptops and white boards as normal so
you might at this point be thinking to yourself well you hardly look like
you're above the legal age to drink
what could you tell me about choosing a career
well it's true that one of the main things we discovered is that we have a
lot to learn
choosing a career is a complex problem and not enough serious research has been
done into how best to do it but we have spent the last three years doing
research with academics at the university of oxford most importantly
we've coached hundreds of people on how to make real career decisions all this
research and thinking has led us to the conclusion that careers advice today
focuses on the wrong thing throughout most of history people basically did
what their parents did some people in the nineteen eighties thought that greed
is good and they focused on making money but our generation grew up with some
different careers advice and that's that you should follow your passion can see
that use of this phrase increased dramatically from the mid nineties but
today I think we need to move beyond follow your passion as the careers
advice to focus on and instead of asking what our own interests and passions are
we should be focusing much more on what we can do for other people and to make
the world a better place
ok so let's go back to my decision
how would follow your passion apply to me I think what follow your passion
tells you to do is three things the first is to identify your greatest
interests second find careers that match those interests
thirdly pursue those careers no matter what finding a fulfilling career is just
a matter of having the courage to pursue your passion in my case I was interested
in martial arts and philosophy remember
so which career should i pick any ideas and I should obviously become a Shaolin
monk but isn't and martial arts together
ok so what's the theory behind this advice you get passion match then you're
really really enjoy working really motivated so you're more likely to be
successful and it was successful doing something you're passionate about
then you have a fulfilling career and spell out like that this really does
sound like pretty reasonable advice right and i can get maybe get behind
that and but let's just think about it in a bit more depth
turns out if you follow your passion
you're probably going to fail why do I say that
let's look at the data a survey of five hundred Canadian students found that
their greatest passions were ice hockey and dance
ninety percent so that they were passionate about sports art music
something like that but if we look at census data we can see that only three
percent of jobs are in our sport and music so it just has to be the case that
even if only one in ten people followed their passion
still the majority would fail to be successful
so this first step just doesn't work
I think the second step is also not reliable in that even if you match your
passion with your work and you're successful you can still quite easily
fail to have a fulfilling career
that's because you might not find the work meaningful
this was a bit like me deciding not to go into finance i thought well i was
interested in it
maybe I could be successful but I wouldn't make a difference so maybe it
would still end up not being fulfilling
so I think the second step doesn't work either now at this point you're probably
you might be thinking okay sure
passion isn't the only thing that matters I follow my passion doesn't
guarantee that I'll succeed but maybe at least makes me more likely to succeed
and to have a fulfilling career as career advice
this is the best we can do but i think that is wrong as well
picture yourself now the most assertive person you know who's really passionate
about selling and persuading and they're really extroverted
surely someone like that should go and go and become an advertising accounts
manager like a madman or they should become a car salesman or something like
that something which involves lots of selling and being extroverted and
talking to people
well it turns out that would be a really bad decision analysis of the term study
showed that really passionate sales people really persuasive assertive types
who went into those kinds of sales jobs actually ended up more likely to burn
out and in fact died younger than normal people who took those jobs
following their passion actually made them more likely to die
and more generally researchers have tried to show for decades that there's a
strong relationship between interest match and how successful and happy
people end up in the work but so far they failed to show a strong connection
between the two
I think this isn't because your interests don't just don't matter but
it's just that when it comes to real career decisions
you're interested just not a decisive factor other things matter much more
like what your skills are and what your mindset is indeed we think our interest
matter a lot more than they do because we really underestimate how much they
change
just think about your own interests
five or ten years ago and how different they are from today
I mean back then you are probably about this tall and you're probably interested
in completely different things
five or ten years time you will be interested in code totally different
things again
all this means that your present interests are just not a solid basis on
which to choose a career
ok so we're not going to focus on interests and what should we focus on if
you're not just going to follow your passion what should you do instead
if I had to sum up careers advice as a single slogan
here's what I would choose do what's valuable
by this I mean focus on getting good at something that genuinely helps others
and make the world a better place that's the secret to a fulfilling career
now obviously doing what's valuable is going to be better for the world you're
gonna do more good like that but people have also thought for millennia that
helping others is the secret to being personally fulfilled and happy
I just gotta represent couple of quotes here just read out the first one
a man's true wealth is the good he does in this world today we actually have
hard data to back this up
professor of psychology Martin Seligman in his 2011 book flourish aim to sum up
the last couple of decades of empirical research into what really causes people
to be satisfied and happy in their lives and 2 of the key ingredients he
identifies just are doing what's valuable
the first of these is achievement or sometimes called mastery and this means
getting really good at something working hard and getting good at something
the second is meaning also called purpose
this means driving to do something greater than just make yourself happy
so it means making the world a better place put the two together get good at
something that makes the world a better place
do what's valuable I think doing what's valuable has lots of other personal
benefits as well for instance even if you work in a charity the people who
have the greatest impact do the most valuable things find it easiest to raise
funding and therefore to pay their bills and that's important too and I've at
least found in my own experience that if you focus on helping others then lots of
people want you to succeed so it's actually easier to be successful as an
interest and compared to just being in it yourself
so it now turns out that actually the advice follow your passion just gets
things backwards rather than start from what we happen to be passionate about
now and then hope that success and a fulfilling career will follow
instead it's much more true to say that we should focus on doing what's valuable
and then that will lead to passion and a fulfilling career I've definitely found
this in my own experience
if when I was 16 you had given me this current test
would you like to give career is going to people i would have clicked the hated
button
I was pretty shy and in science and the idea of getting career advice people was
not appealing at all but now I spend all of my time thinking about careers advice
and absolutely obsessed and fascinated by it
focusing on doing what's valuable has given me clear concrete meaningful goals
that's made my life a lot better there's no more endless reflection on which of
my interests represents my true calling
which doesn't exist anyway so how can you actually do what's valuable in your
careers what practical steps should you follow and this is what we spend most of
our time trying to work out to 80,000 hours
I'm just going to give you a super quick summary of three things we say that you
can do
the first of these is to explore
learn all you can about the world and test yourself out in different things
if you want to do what's valuable you have to discover that out there in the
world
you can't figure it out just by thinking about your own interests
secondly get some go off to some skills and try and get good at them
these skills that are really in demand and can be used in many different areas
I might pick computer programming as an example for the next decade
this bit is where your passions do come in thinking about your passions does
come in because what you're passionate about now
can give you clues about what you can get really good at in the future
so that's where thinking about but they're not the only thing that matters
and then when you get those skills go and find the biggest most pressing
social problems you can and apply your skills to solving them
don't just pick a problem that is important try and find one that's been
unfair knee unfairly neglected by other people because that's where you'll have
the greatest impact and finally don't think that in order to do what's
valuable you have to become a doctor and personally go to Africa and help people
with your own two hands
big social problems can be and often are solved by research by developing new
technology by spreading big ideas in the arts and the key is to work out where
your skills can fit into have the greatest impact
I think the idea that we should focus on doing what's valuable is actually really
intuitive one I want you now just imagine that you're on your deathbed and
you're looking back at your 80,000 our career rather than just about to start
it and picture yourself two ways it could have gone in the first you say to
yourself I was good at what i did i enjoyed what I did
I'm a lot of money now i have two houses and yachts
but what was it all for in the second you say to yourself I absolutely worked
my ass off at a charity and often wasn't easy but through my efforts i was able
to prevent the deaths of a hundred children due to malaria
what was it all for the first scenario happens all the time but the second
scenario is almost unimaginable
of course that was a worthwhile career altruism is one thing you'll never
regret if we really want to be fulfilled in our own careers
we have to stop focusing so much on our own interests and instead ask what we
can do for other people
imagine a world in which that was the thoughts on everyone's minds
so to find work you love
don't just follow your passion rather do what's valuable explore build skills
solve big pressing problems and from that fulfillment and a passionate career
will emerge
you've got 80,000 hours in your career don't waste them do what's valuable
yeah
