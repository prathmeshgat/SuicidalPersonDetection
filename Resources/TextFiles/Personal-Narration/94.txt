so I manga
I'm 18 and I'm a hacker and when I say that I don't really mean i'm here to
steal your data
I truly love circumventing limitations
that's what hacking movie is all about when i was 13 i put my greatest hack
I have two into one of india's largest gaming companies it was here that I
realized hacking really is just about three things firstly you have to cut
through the noise
secondly no matter what there's always patterns and noise and thirdly you have
to question these patterns leverage them when i was studying for my exams a few
years ago
this is what was really appalling
all right I I realize how much noise
indian students have to go through there's craft books notebooks
Roxas - she North's to shun teachers what your friend is telling your body
exam and there is an entire industry about this problem that kids don't know
how to study what to study are all of this is an entire industry around this
informational in bands called coaching classes intuition teachers and this to
me is fundamentally wrong because examinations aren't about picking the
right option on this press
they should be about creating an intelligent workforce for industries and
this is going to hit me know
I said you know what I'm gonna hack
the examination system after it
ok
so what i did was i just sat down like any other half when I up
that's the longest and a lot of stale pizza by the way and I sat down and I
start to see the patterns in noise and it turns out exams have this noise and
they have these patterns in this noise
this is what led to an app that I created that we like to call examine Phi
examine fire tells you what to study
quite simply put
so we're taking question papers from all over India every school every college
tradition
you name it we have it and we're running this data through some incredibly
complex algorithms like reminding the data and running it with natural
language processing to track things in question papers so long story sharp
yeah
long story short they're gonna be predicting a question
and a lot of you you're going to ask me how's that going to happen
how what if somebody else that said that about stock market a couple of years ago
that is examined by examined by make sure you spend time studying only the
most important questions for any exam
you can also track the amount of time you're taking this all very question and
compete
this is an incredibly pretty graph of a difficulty report for a question
it shows you how everybody across the country is finding a particular question
if everybody is finding it difficult
you don't really need to start you do
our dream for example fide is to distribute high-quality exam preparation
materials throughout India
thank you I have a massive dynamic college tomorrow and we'll be heading
well thank you
