I love sushi true statement also the name of the single greatest japanese
restaurant in the greater Bay Area it was on the one that I discovered this
magical little place in downtown Santa Cruz but i think it was fate that
brought me to it because really isn't it fate that brings all of us to our
best-kept secrets i love sushi is a little shabby on the outside but I think
that's what makes it a gem the neon open sign slightly shady parking lot and
location don't quite match the friendly atmosphere once you open the doors
upon entering the restaurant you're greeted by friendly waitress says seated
immediately and offer tons of free food but it's not just free food
it's awesome free food at a mommy california rolls miso soup if you've
ever been to dinner at rest at a Japanese restaurant you know how
important these things are to your meal but they usually had quite a bit to your
goal not here and I wasn't just bribed into liking this place the service is
great two friends of mine have enough confidence in the waitress in the
waitresses and the menu to save on ordering surprised me today and trust me
there's nothing funny about the audience for the roles like the journey love
these rolls are plentiful and simply put amazing a good driver the restaurant is
matched even double by mr. kam the owner he constantly tracks on his tables and
genuinely wants to know how your meals going
the walls are decorated with enduring pictures of him and local surfers even
some celebrities mr. Kim's a nice guy and his presence also means potentially
more free stuff for you and I know but even under each customers are still
fully entertained by the fact that if you have a sake bomb on your table mr.
Kim will challenge you to see who can drink one faster and trust me he never
fails to rise to the occasion some of the funniest times remember here when Mr
Kim gulps down a cup of beer and sake faster than most customers can even pick
up their drink and he has enough experience that he promises to pay for
another drink for you if he loses and the entertainment doesn't just stop
there on friday and saturday nights my favorite time to go the back room turns
into the funniest karaoke bar you've ever seen large parties are also always
accommodated and around the restaurant making you feel at home and all the
excitement and free food
lastly and best of all after paying your extremely reasonable bill like any good
japanese restaurant
you can grab all the dumb lollipops your little heart desires perhaps the makeup
for the remarks you feel once you have to leave this place all the while your
subconscious echoes the quite fitting name of the establishment
I love sushi thank you
