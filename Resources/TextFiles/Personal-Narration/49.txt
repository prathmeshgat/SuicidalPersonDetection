when was the last time you had no idea what you were doing
okay I'll go first how does that sound a couple of years ago I decided I wanted
to learn Spanish in preparation for a trip i was taking to Mexico
I know friends I thought how hard could it be
so I did what any self-respecting member of the 21st century would do to become
fluent in a language i downloaded a flashcard app on my iPhone
ok so flash forward a few months
my two girlfriends and I had just arrived in cancun we leave the airport
we get in the cab and I decided I'm going to make some small talk with the
cab driver so I confidently state X toy story exit ah Iran hotel
porque soy casada some of you know where this is going out
ok and the look on the cab drivers face made it instantly clear that i had not
just said I'm excited to go to the hotel because I'm tired
what I'd actually said was I'm sexually excited to go to the hotel because i
just got married
so needless to say I felt exposed and embarrassed but what about you
maybe you're struggling to run your business fighting to master a skill you
need to do your job
we're just trying to lower your golf handicap have you been meaning to get a
mentor or take a class or in my case find a Spanish tutor but you never
really got around to it
you know what I'm talking about right it's that thing you've been dying to
master
and if you're a type a person like me it probably haunts you
and the form of a line on your to do list that you never cross off because
you're so bogged down in the tyranny of the urgent
have you experienced that so whether you're a business leader and employee a
hobbyist or a beer league hockey player
how much time and energy do you invest to become totally awesome at what you do
here's my big idea when it comes to your own development
you can't keep waiting until you're less busy or for someone else to do it for
you
no one will truly invest in you but you now my life's work is to help leaders be
better
this passion began in my childhood when I saw the power of leaders to transform
people's lives
shortly after my parents divorce my mother started her own business and it
didn't just support our family
it support the families of the 25 people who worked for her and now as a grownup
an organizational psychologist
I apply the scientific principles of human behavior to help leaders and
companies succeed but a client of mine recently explained what i do far better
than I ever could
here's what she said leadership is my Everest and you are my Sherpa
pretty great so in the last 12 years of being an executive sherpa or coach i
stumbled upon a pattern
three steps for radical improvement that don't just apply to business leadership
they apply to anything he wants to do better and today I'm going to share them
with you
but before I do that you might be thinking really anything
in short yes whether you're a bodybuilder or a bartender a surgeon or
a screenwriter a violinist or a volunteer if there's something you want
to do better
these three things will help you become totally awesome at what you do
okay so three things we get started
excellent all right step one is to know thyself
here's the bottom line most people are completely delusional about their own
skills and capabilities true and I can prove it
researchers Justin Kruger and David Dunning uncovered this phenomenon which
they modestly named the dunning-kruger effect but some of you might be more
into NPR than science and you might know it as the Lake Wobegon effect
so in a series of four experiments Krugerrands ending found that most
people completely overestimate their talent
what was even scarier at least to me was that the least competent people were the
worst at recognizing their and competence
are we bad people rarely are we stupid not usually we just live in a world
where people hardly ever tell the truth
we're polite were busy were afraid and then there's the classic frontal attack
of can I give you some feedback
now if you don't run the other way when someone says that to you you're probably
feeling a little defensive when you hear what they have to say
aren't you so for me and my work coaching leaders i'm often sent in to
tell someone the truth when everyone else is afraid to
and today i'll tell you a story about exact an executive coach named Steve but
remember these three steps apply to anything you want to do better
okay so here's the deal
when I met Steve he thought he was doing a bang-up job
but when i talk to his team I learned pretty quickly that that wasn't the case
they said he is as smart as they come but they told me he had some let's just
call them quirks
no no let's be honest his team thought he was a jerk he would bark orders at
them he would question their confidence he would scream at them in a way they
found unprofessional and frightening is the true story
one of his employees had just started taking blood pressure medicine because
of it
and lucky me i got to be the jerk who told him all of that so just imagine
that you're with me in Steve's play shal corner office
so we sit across from each other at his huge wooden conference table
I looked him dead in the eyes I said Steve there's no way around this
your team hates you are you surprised and horrified expression said that he
was incredibly surprised she said how could they say these things about me
how could they say that I yell so then he stared out the window for what seemed
to me like an eternity said you mean I've been doing these things for the
last 20 years
I nobody told me but eager to give some good news i said Steve
don't worry these problems are totally fixable and you just took the most
important step
I did really great wait what did i do you just accepted reality
so what about you
if you had room for improvement would you know
delusions about ourselves are the roadblocks on the journey to becoming
awesome
so no matter how hard it is you have to take responsibility for learning the
truth about yourself
so how do you do that here's my advice for you step 1 means knowing where you
stand
so first if you have
of them you should be looking at your objective measures of success a surgeon
might look at her complication rates a gardener might look at which of her
plants have lived and which if not then you look at your subjective measures the
easiest way to do this is to find someone who will tell you the truth
ask them what am i doing that's helping me succeed what's getting in the way and
how can i adapt my approach to be better
remember above all seek the truth
ok so you've gotten this feedback you know where you stand
step two is to pick one thing to work on
in my experience once people have all this feedback they are raring to go
and they wake up the next day and try to change everything
think about that it's ridiculous isn't it it's like going on a crash diet to
lose 10 pounds in a week
here's the truth it is far better to make progress on one thing then little
to none on many things
let's go back to Steve we can all probably agree that he had lots of
choices of things to work on right
but there was one thing that would give him the most bang for his buck
you know what it is Steve had to learn to get control of his anger
we agreed that we wouldn't work on anything else until we got that under
control
so over the course of the next month that's exactly what he did
he learned to soften the tone of his voice he learned to bite his tongue he
learned to question instead of blame and lo and behold in a matter of weeks
he started to get a handle on it so we moved to listening skills then to
coaching on and on it went
one thing at a time for months so what do you think Steve noticed in a very
short time he felt a new level of confidence
now this wasn't hollow confidence that comes from delusion
it was real confidence because he was doing the right thing
now what is steve's team notice
in a very short period they started talking about this wonderful guy who
they called the new Steve it was awesome
and the best part was when he would back track which we all do and we're trying
to improve they would ask him lovingly what with the new Steve say about that
it's pretty great right
so for you how do you pick your one thing
here's my advice take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle on the
left hand side list all the skills you're trying to improve then on the
right-hand side for each skill on a scale of one to ten I want you to
imagine that you only got better at that and then rate how much more awesome you
would be start with the highest number and work your way down
so you know yourself
you've got your one thing if you stop here you're making a mistake I see all
the time and it's very dangerous
I call it delusional development the feudal hope that just by wanting to get
better at something that magically you will as if through osmosis
it's kind of like my trying to learn spanish through a flashcard app
I think we've established that that was no bueno
so the only thing at this point standing between you and awesome is daily
practice for hundreds of years people used to think that excellence was in
born
for example scientists used to think that the best marathon runners had
differences in their lungs or their muscles but recent research reveals that
these differences are not in board
what makes someone exceptional is that they earn it through daily practice
so the best marathon runners don't actually show physical differences
what's different is how much they trained in the weeks leading up to the
marathon
so let's go back to Steve shall we
Steve learn to practice daily by developing a habit every day on his way
to work he distinct about what he was trying to improve and make a plan to
practice it then on the way home he would think about how we did and maybe
some ideas for what he would do the next day
in sum total Steve probably spent less than 30 minutes a week doing this and he
saw massive returns in less than six months if team started closing new deals
he felt happier and more confident and his boss who hired me was ecstatic
so what do you think are some people born to be great
sometimes but my belief is that Steve showed us that with effort and
commitment
almost anyone can be better in his case a better leader now
by the way i always say that ninety six percent of leaders can improve the other
four percent are what we call sociopaths
who lack the ability to connect with other people on a fundamental human
level right so unless your associate path you can be a better leader but I
digress
let's get back to practice the bottom line you will not improve unless you
make a daily commitment to practice
so every day I want you to jump out of bed and say today is the day that I'll
get better at my one thing
some days you feel stuck other days you'll be thrilled when something clicks
but every day you'll learn and every day you'll get better
so before we end I want you to imagine that you are there you become totally
awesome at what you do
what's that like how does it feel
how's your life better Steve did it was he a superhuman an exception to the rule
absolutely not steve was a normal person who made a true commitment to his own
development
know thyself
pick one thing practice daily
that's all there is to it and I promise you after using this framework with
thousands of leaders
I know with absolute certainty that it works now here's the time
here is the moment for you to make a decision as your Sherpa i can show you
the way
but this is your mountain to climb remember no one will invest in you but
you so make the commitment
follow the three steps you'll become more awesome at what you do every day
and you'll be utterly unstoppable
what are you waiting for
