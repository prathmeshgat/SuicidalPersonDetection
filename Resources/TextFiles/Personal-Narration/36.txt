my name is Ryan Nicodemus and this is joshua fields melbourne
and the two of us run a website called the minimalists calm and today we want
to talk to you about what it means to be part of a community but first i want to
share a story with you about how i became rich imagine your life
a year from now two years from now five years from now
what's it going to look like
imagine a life with less less stuff less clutter less stress and debt and
discontent a life with fewer distractions joking right now right
we're trying to talk sorry about that
now imagine a life with more more time more meaningful relationships more
growth and contribution a life of passion unencumbered by the trappings of
the Catholic world around you
what what you're imagining is an intentional life
it's not a perfect life it's not even an easy life but a simple one
what you're imagining is a rich life the kind of rich that has nothing to do with
wealth
you know I used to think rich was earning fifty thousand dollars a year
then when i started climbing the corporate ladder in my twenties I
quickly began turning 50 grand
but I need to feel rich so i tried to adjust for inflation
maybe seventy five thousand dollars a year was rich maybe 90,000 maybe six
figures or maybe owning a bunch of stuff
maybe that was rich well whatever rich was I knew that once I got there I would
finally be happy
so as I made more money i spent more money all in the pursuit of the American
dream
all in the pursuit
of happiness but the closer I got but farther away happiness was five years
ago my entire life was different from what it is today
radically different I had everything I ever wanted
I had everything I was supposed to have I had an impressive job title with a
respectable corporation a successful career managing hundreds of employees
I earned a six-figure income i bought a fancy new car every couple years
I owned a huge three-bedroom condo it even had two living rooms
I have no idea why single guy needs two living rooms
I was living the American dream everyone around me said I was successful but I
was only ostensibly successful
you see I also had a bunch of things that were hard to see from the outside
even though i earned a lot of money i had heaps of debt but chasing the
American dream
it cost me a lot more than money
my life was filled with stress and anxiety and discontent
I was miserable
I may have look successful but I certainly didn't feel successful and it
got to a point in my life where I don't know what was important anymore but one
thing was clear there was this gaping void in my life so I tried to fill that
void the same way many people do with stuff lots of stuff
I was filling the void with consumer purchases i bought new cars and
electronics and closets full of expensive clothes about furniture and
expensive home decorations and always make sure to have all the latest gadgets
oh and one at it i didn't have enough cash in the bank
i paid for expensive meals rounds of drinks and frivolous vacations with
credit cards
i was spending money faster than I earned it
attempting to buy my way to happiness
and I thought I'd get there one day eventually I mean happiness had to be
somewhere just around the corner right but the stuff didn't fill the void it
widened it and because i didn't know what was important i continue to fill
the void with stuff going further into debt
working hard to buy things that weren't making me happy
this one on for years
a terrible cycle lather rinse repeat by my late twenties my life on the outside
looked great but on the inside I was a wreck I was several years divorced
I was unhealthy I was stuck
I drink a lot I did drugs a lot i use as many pacifiers as i could and i continue
to work 60 70 sometimes 80 hours a week when i first took some of the most
important aspects of my life
I barely ever thought about my health my relationships my passions and worst of
all I felt stagnant
I certainly wasn't contributing to others and I wasn't growing my life
lacked meaning purpose passion
if you would have asked me what I was passionate about
I would have looked at you like a deer in headlights what am i passionate about
I had no idea I was living paycheck to paycheck living for a paycheck living
for stuff living for career that I didn't love but i wasn't really living
at all
I was depressed then as I was approaching my thirties I noticed
something different about my best friend of 20 something years
Josh seem happy for the first time in a really long time like truly happy
a static but i didn't understand why we have worked side by side of the same
corporation throughout our twenties both climbing the ranks and he had been just
as miserable as me
something had to have changed to boot he had just gone through two of the most
difficult events of his life his mother just passed away and his marriage ended
both in the same month he wasn't supposed to be happy
he certainly wasn't supposed to be happier than me so I did what any good
best friend would do
I took Josh out to lunch i SAT him down and I asked him a question why the hell
are you so happy
he spent the next 20 minutes telling me about something called minimalism
he talked about how he spent the last few months
simplifying his life getting the clutter out of the way to make room for what was
truly important and then he introduced me to an entire community of people who
had done the same thing
he introduced me to a guy named Colin right a 24 year old entrepreneur who
travels to a new country every four months carrying with them everything
that he owns then there was Joshua Becker a 36 year old husband and father
of two with a full-time job and a car and the house and suburban vermont and
then he showed me Kourtney Carver a 40 year old wife and mother to a teenage
daughter and salt lake city and there was leave about to a 38 year old husband
and father of six in San Francisco
although all these people were living considerably different lives people from
different backgrounds with children and families in different work situations
they all share at least two things in common
first they were living deliberate meaningful lives they were passionate
and purpose driven
they seemed much richer than any of the so-called rich guys I worked with in the
corporate world and second they attributed their meaningful lives to
this thing called minimalism
so me being the problem solving guy that I am I decided to become a minimalist
right there on the spot
I looked up at Josh I excitedly declared all right now I'm going to do it and
then I'm going to be a minimalist
now what you see i don't want to spend months paring down my items like he had
that was great for him but I wanted faster results
so we came up with this idea of a packing party
we decided to pack all my belongings as if I were moving and then I would unpack
only the items i needed over the next three weeks
Josh literally helped me box up everything
my clothes my kitchen where my towels my TV's my electronics my frame photographs
and paintings my toiletries
even my furniture everything after nine hours and a couple of pizza deliveries
everything was packed so there Josh and I were sitting in my second living room
feeling exhausted staring at boxes stacked halfway to my 12 foot ceiling my
condo is empty and everything smelled like cardboard
everything I own every single thing i had worked hard for over the last decade
was sitting there in that room just boxes stacked on top of boxes stacked on
top of boxes
now each box was labeled so I know where to go when i needed a particular item
labels like living room
junk drawer number one kitchenware bedroom closet junk drawer number nine
so forth and so on I spent the next 21 days unpacking
only the items and needed my toothbrush my bed and bed sheets
the furniture i actually used some kitchen where the toolset just the
things that added value to my life
after three weeks
eighty percent of my stuff was still sitting in those boxes just sitting
there on accessed all those things that were supposed to make me happy
they weren't doing the job so i decided to donate and sell all of it
you know what I started to feel rich
for the first time I started to feel rich once i got everything out of the
way I made room for everything that remains a month later my entire
perspective had changed and then I thought to myself maybe some people
might find value in my story in our story
so right and I did I guess what anyone would do we started a blog
we call it the minimalists when I was three years ago and something amazing
happen
52 people visited our website in the first month
52 I realized that might sound unremarkable at first but that meant
that our story was resonating with dozens people and then other amazing
things started happening
52 readers turned into 500 500 became five thousand and now more than 2
million people a year
read our words it turns out that when you add value to people's lives
they're pretty eager to share the message with their friends and their
family to add value to their lives
adding value it's a basic human instinct
in fact that's why we're here today a couple years ago Ryan and I moved from
ohio to Montana and what we discovered here was an entire community of people
people who weren't traditionally wealthy but who were rich in a different way we
discovered so many people who were willing to contribute beyond themselves
and that's what makes a real community contribution and so
we'd like to encourage everyone to take a look at your day to day lives
take a look at whatever eats up the majority of your time is it
checking email or Facebook or watching TV
is it shopping online or at retail stores
is it working hard for a paycheck to buy stuff you don't need things that don't
make you happy now
it's not that we think that there's anything inherently wrong with material
possessions or working a nine-to-five there's not
we all need some stuff will have to pay the bills right
it's just that when we put those things first we tend to lose sight of our real
priorities lose sight of life's purpose and so maybe getting some of the excess
stuff out of the way
clearing the clutter from our lives can help us all focus on
well everything that remains things like health relationships growth contribution
community
thank you
yeah
