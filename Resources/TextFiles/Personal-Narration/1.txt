in one week I had gained enough weight that just doesn't fit anymore 
yes 
and whoever is tradition 
family that each year in each of our birthdays we go to destroy storing each one of the guests by one and only one toy 
it's my birthday 
ago this store smithii I walk in and my brothers rush to the boy section on the left 
they're so excited to buy this toy 
it's been around totally not it's called but when 
and it was the toy of the era feeling almost a dozen shelves vividly colored and vividly defined in all sizes and shapes 
I would love to go and buy one but wait 
to my right stands as the only feminine memory 
I've had as a child 
our version of a girl doll and the perfect doll for any young girl at my age 
standing with the fake his smile 
offering me her eternal friendship 
telling me to come and buy her 
it was the toughest decision of my life for an eight year old I was 
I'm crying weeping my eyes out I look like a hound dog I turn around to the one and only my father 
look up to him that I don't know what to do my father being the wise man that he is puts his hands on my shoulders and tells me you know follow your heart 
I guess what I want carrying home with me outright walkouts

little 
the first years I had people pressuring me 
I have my my grandmother had my teacher had 
people a lot of people pushing me and pushing me to be a girl stuff straight what he what your mouth full don't snore while you're sleeping dnmt 
it wasn't no for me 
my parents got concerned with the whole issue please they made it an issue and decide to take me into an all girl school 
see here's the trick I don't know is an all girl school until that Thursday I walk in there 
I Walkin 
I look around

second of all why is the school painted with colors that actually hurt my I 
I look up to my mother mom what is this 
to them to be as cold as she can get she tells me you know is an all girls school your father and I made the decision is fair own good and she storms off 
I walk in 
it's like a walking to markets 
I know nobody ever I hated their girls were allowed squeaky their interests included pop stars and pink

she was utterly terribly 
awfully nice

Matt what did I have will bid you know if I'm if my mother comes to me one morning tells me that you're having chocolate today I would screen out of the at street and screaming Hallelujah nnj 
I'm staring dreamily at her food 
she can tell I want to eat the lunch box 
usually the whole lunch boxes we need to get a two earner don 
couldn't possibly eat this kiedy girls food 
so I just take one bite and give it back to her 
in two months in a period of two months this girl after spending time with her 
often after getting my heart really fought for her niceness 
and kindness 
I became more of a girl 
I've accomplished something I've never thought I would 
I have people trying to JB for five years 
into being a girl I had been pushing me does god she's been two months 
only because she didn't pressure to me ten push it to me she simply invited me leaders ago would you like to be one yes I would because I have some tea with that dnmt 
moral of the story 
change is part of life 
it can be hard can be easy but it's part of life 
and I said by the English naturalist Charles Darwin is not the strongest of the species that survives nor the most intelligent but rather the one was adaptable to change 
and he's a good guy 
in just a piece of advice for each and everyone of you 
don't change for anyone and don't change if you don't want to cause your beautiful the way you are critical nnj
