student so without further ado our 2012 class de guest speaker and ease amber
sorry sorry about the music start
what happened there
that song is just so much I just met that guy
haha
all right i'm gonna just have to compose myself to show must go on here
students faculty parents grandparents uncles that were invited but showed up
anyway
handsome young janitors who are secretly math geniuses
and the homeless guy from with honors
my name is andy samberg and I'm is honored to be here today as I am
unqualified
there's a storied history of incredible class date speakers here at Harvard
Nobel Prize laureate mother teresa former US president bill clinton and now
me the fake rap weiner songs guy
I'm also just over the moon to be receiving an honorary degree here today
I mean never in my wildest dreams tonight with that
no degree
so what I'm just like just like a professor or
nothing then why am I here
perfect Dean Hammonds you like all right I was this crappy speech though
yeah I flew my folks in here we go
class of 2012
you are graduating from college
that means this is the first day of the last day of your life
no that's wrong this is the last day of the first day of school
note that's worse
this is a day
you know I to turn to Webster's dictionary and it to find harvard as the
season for gathering crops
admittedly that's actually the definition of our best but it was the
closest word i can find a Harvard that wasn't a proper noun
and in the end isn't that what Harvard is really about though
planting the seeds of knowledge that eventually produce crops AKA money in
order to satisfy the farmers your parents who pay like 45,000 crops a year
to send you to harvest just so you could major in women's agriculture see what
I'm doing for a move on the world outside of Harvard has asked me to make
a quick announcement
the following majors are apparently useless as of tomorrow
history literature all things related to art social studies
east asian studies pretty much anything that ends with studies
romance languages and finally folklore and mythology
come on guys just study something useful and play World of Warcraft in your free
time okay
anyhow all those majors now useless unless you can somehow turn them into an
iPhone app math and science majors you guys are cool
yeah finally the 2012 is a great time to be graduated from college
sure the job markets a little slow sure our health care and social security
systems are going to evaporate in five years
sure you'll have to work till you're 80 to support your 110 year old parents who
will live forever because of nanotechnology sure the concept of love
will soon disappear leaving us all only robots ready to kill our best friend for
luke warm cup of microchip soup but that doesn't matter because tomorrow you
graduate from harvest Harvard from Harvard
it's where you will graduate now i'm sure a lot of you are looking up here
and thinking what makes this guy so special you know what is he accomplished
he didn't even go to Harvard well to you i say this i didn't even apply too hard
ok because i knew i wouldn't get it
boom suck on that
I don't accept you the steam college I break up first
I move on and you see me with my hot new girlfriend she's riding shotgun in my
convertible sebring
that's right the ones that Harvard was always begging me to rent we went up the
coast and I'm just laughing and looking really fit like this even hitting the
gym nope just eating right and making positive choices and I really wanted
that honorary debris
well I guess the old saying is true
never trust Dean Hammonds regardless
Harvard remains iconic in our culture one thing that sticks out in my mind is
the central role this campus played and one of the most important films ever
made about social connections and how we communicate
I'm referring of course to 1986 whimsical blackface Rob soul man
starring see thomas Howell is a white student posing as an african-american in
order to exploit affirmative action
he was in Harvard Law in that movie and that movie exists now most of you don't
know this yet but Harvard is one of the few schools you can attend that can also
eventually become your workplace nickname
who's that Mama is this in the break room probably Harvard's whose vest was
in my parking spot
I'm going with Harvard's in fact once you graduate you can never wear your
Harvard sweatshirt in public again without looking like a world-class a
whole
I honestly think the coop should sell university of michigan t-shirts that you
can wear just to blend in once you're adding here and to clarify when I say
the coop I mean your campus bookstore and not famous film actor bradley cooper
who may also refer to as the coop and who also sells books and sweatshirts in
his free time
speaking of Fame Harvard has many famous alumni Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates just a
few ex-students that started successful businesses after dropping out which
means if you're in this crowd today and graduating
you're destined to be a massive failure
sorry those are just the facts also a fact class day is a terrible name for a
day when you don't have to go to class like ever again
it's pretty much like calling New Year's Eve sobriety night
hey you going out for sobriety night yeah it's gonna suck and now on a more
literary note I'd like to read a poem by the great WB Yeats which is actually
pronounced least a lot of people don't know that
thanks for the heads up Barney Frank anyways
this is a truly beautiful and poignant passage from the nineteen twenty nine
collection the winding stair and other poems and I think it's especially
applicable to today's ceremonies goes like this
this is how it - who had
this is how do with it
it's Friday night and I feel alright
hit the shore cause I'm hey Dad
honey's in the streets a money yeah I'm a dad
there's more but you get a classic eats an important poet now while i am truly
excited to be here today i'll be honest at 33 years of age i have an indoor
lived that much more than you guys
so in order to give you a broader scope of what's to come
I reached out and asked for some words of wisdom from some people that I
thought were relevant to your experience here
the aforementioned Mark Zuckerberg who was a Harvard student was kind enough to
send me some remarks that i will relate to you now
well hey guys it's me mark or as my friend Kofi Anan calls me uncle Barry
Finn
oh he thought of that I just wanted to give a quick congrats to all but really
congrats to me you know since I left things have gone so good you guys like a
six-year-old fantasy of the future good
in fact I recent completed the Harvard trifecta start your own company have a
movie made about you and marry an asian dr. track down
so everyone out there be sure to upgrade to timeline and lay off the Pinocchio's
pizza
haha i went to Harvard what he had to say
i also asked for you know the local experience i asked Massachusetts native
mark wahlberg to send over some thoughts for you guys
and here's what he had to say
hey Harvard has going you guys graduate home
I think that's great we should do a film together what you think guys are super
smart right
I use the prosthetic penis and be nice okay just think about it
say hi to your mother for me okay he asked me to say that to you guys and
then finally I asked block blockbuster superstar nic cage for some remarks
now I realize he didn't go to Harvard and he's not from Boston but he has a
special connection to this place that I'll let him explain
here's what he wrote good afternoon
as I write you currently digging a tunnel into the bowels of the widener
library when I finally breach its mighty walls
I will steal the legendary Gutenberg Bible and return it to its rightful
owner Steve Guttenberg
you know I've seen some weird stuff in my day
understand cool i saw a small child swallow a pelican hole in the Sahara
Desert I saw heard of oxen fly into a portal and disappear from our world
forever
but no matter what I've seen there's been one thing I've held to be true love
is the most powerful force this universe has to offer and we should show kindness
to all around us
with the exception of Dean Hammond who is a filthy liar
and that my friends is the true meaning of Hanukkah
I'd love to keep writing but now the time has come for me to ride on to my
next adventure
what's that you ask simple I'm gonna have sex with the statue of John Harvard
and those are my three impressions
thank you guys
late night television
let me straight here now we've been paying a lot of attention to the
students here today but I want to take a moment and acknowledge all the parents
in particular I want to give a shout out to all the moms in the house give it up
absolutely our moms are moms put up with so much and they ask for so little and
as I look out at all the beautiful mothers here today
I can't help but be filled with an overwhelming sense of horniness
oh yes
you're fine crop indeed
and I likes me some older ladies
they know how to do stuff you know what I mean
so all the moms open invitation
nobody got to know ballot before all you dad's out there get upset
I mean notice notice respect really and you got to be something special if
you've got such fine ladies on your arms in fact as I look at all these strong
loyal men
I can't help but be filled with an overwhelming sense of horniness
oh yes
see a lot of silver foxes out there today and Harvard a cheap with my sugar
daddy Zach's yeah I see you
you don't have to raise your hand open invitation gentlemen
nobody gets to New
and now I'd like to get a little serious as you move forward in the world there
will be obstacles but every challenge is a chance for success
you know what I'm sorry I had a whole inspirational section of this prepared
but it just feels funny now so I'm going to scrap descriptive words and and just
speak to you guys from the heart
yeah this stuff is much more from the heart
look the things i'm about to say to you aren't to make any friends and they're
not for some cheap applause okay
it's real talk and it comes from my soul so listen up
yale sucks balls
am I right here
yeah
they're the worst haha
yale asked me to do their class day speech but I could make it to the stage
because i kept slipping in all their drool like a second-tier safety school
in the worst city in America
guys I'm kidding New Haven's nicer now then rwanda little-known fact about Yale
it was built on top of an ancient Native American toilets
it is no wonder they're called the Bulldogs they're a bunch of big headed
in bread with breathing problems and that comes with my apologies to any
inbreds here today don't let anyone compare you to a Yalie and like this all
might sound harsh but in truth Yale is basically a sewer filled with mold
people only replace the word people with stinky dried up dog turds that hate
laughter and puppies and that's my heart stuff you guys from my soul for some of
you might have been tough to hear but I felt it was my duty to give it to you
straight
also quick confession i know literally nothing about you but I will say this
darkness can burn in hell
class day
you know it's hard to know where life will take you from here
what adventures will have which sitcoms you'll write for but my advice to you is
simple
relax just finished college at Harvard you worked so hard
trust me you're going to kill him I went to santa cruz and then I transferred to
film school and I'm rich
ok and i don't mean spiritually rich or any hippie crap like that i'm talking
about racks on racks believe it
I'm being a little hyperbolic to seem cool but i am up against mother teresa
on this thing okay
have you guys youtube your class day speech she was like krumping and
throwing bags of money into the crowd i'm going to take some liberties but in
the days ahead a lot of people will tell you to trust your instincts and don't be
afraid to take chances and I am definitely one of those people
but I would also say this don't rush into the next phase of your life whether
it's grad school at Harvard or grad school at MIT or massively disappointing
your parents by exploring your art made out of garbage thing whatever it is you
try make sure it's what you really want to do because the only person who knows
what that is is you
and if all else fails just remember these beautiful words from the film dead
poets society now
my deal is dead boy
which now that I've said it out loud
did not quite drive home I . as much as I had hoped
in fact I'm realizing that only like seven percent of what I've said today
has been at all helpful or even passable is English but in the end i feel i'm
only truly qualified to give you three simple tips on how to succeed in life
one cut a hole in a box
- put your junk in said box
three make her or him
open the box and that's the way you do it
also I can't believe I'm about to say this but Dean Kamen's I forgive you
bygones be bygones already got that sweet degree from santa cruz and film
school anyway so thank you graduates
Godspeed and congratulations play these
