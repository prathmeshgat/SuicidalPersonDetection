thank you
so the other day i was giving a talk to a bunch of young models on having a
career in the fashion industry and i really wanted to tell me more about my
upcoming TED talk so I go hey guys is anyone here heard of Ted and in typical
model fashion
this is the reply again yeah I've seen them both and the teddy bears hilarious
right what the youth of today it made me laugh so much
I mean I can't really say much when I was 15 I wanted to be a bodybuilder
not just anybody building though the number one
arnold schwarzenegger i actually remember day one on my attempt to get a
body like this guy
there was this local old school gym in east london and it looked like something
that you might see in a rocky movie it was this converted garage space with
ripped black benches rusting barbells and these posters of X bodybuilding
champions on the wall including Schwarzenegger himself as a goal to
aspire to
now the day I walked in there i met the owner this proper cockney guy who dave i
described to him my health and fitness goals in great lengthy detail
you know just like an adolescent kid does
I want to get massive
he nodded you know he really understood what i wanted the point of the squat
rack and he says that over there son
make it big legs and that over there . into the bench press
hehe a big chest and he's dumb bells who for gardens and as a buy a coffee goes
on
so if i did go dad I mean it was a pretty simple concept really if you can
get from A to B in eight repetitions you just add more weight
now this time in my life I hadn't yet studies for science
so little did I know but this a to b method i was using we refer to as
overload
now the overload very works like this if i push my body to failure
meaning I no longer have the capability to do any more repetitions
then when i'm resting my body simply produces more muscle that allows me to
live more next time
I can work around the body using this method on each muscle group
hey presto one day you have body like honor
well I obviously do not have a body
my garnish good in fact that i have a body like a fashion model and that's
because i was scouted in the street and was forced to give up on my bodybuilding
dream
so this is one of my first shows this is me strutting down the catwalk for Calvin
client the casting director
thank you because they're 80 is backstage before the show
teaching us how to walk in a strong posture be straight
anyone in shoulders back and down but why am i early twenties was are being
taught how to walk
more importantly why did walk in this way through so alien be on the outside
to the audience
it looks quite powerful I mean all they were asking me to do was walk like I was
supposed to walk so i decided to go to a place where just being in strong posture
was common practice and I was about to meet the person face-to-face
that would destroy my aspiration of Schwarzenegger forever so I was
attempting an exercise called a bridge and I'll gymnastics class and I just
couldn't get my arm straight let alone my body off the ground so the coach
called somebody over who demonstrates this movement effortlessly
she was a six-year-old girl
this is actually her her name is Grace
Amazing Grace how sweet
but what I really began to see is a principle is being used in gymnastics
class
why identical to the posture keys are being given backstage during Fashion
Week
it's the language of gymnastics
that's not based on individual muscles but based on it
movements of the joints and the skeleton for example they use shoulder instead of
biceps triceps hips
instead of quads hamstrings completely the opposite to what the fitness
industry prioritizes fitness talks muscles before spine
you see gymnast focus on how they are moving their body and they also just
happen to have awesome posture and a really strong core
it's really no coincidence this is a byproduct of working with the body
in fact that prioritization of the spine is a much smarter approach if you happen
to damage or spinal cord you can actually lose the ability to move any
part of your body and this is something we've been reminded of our whole lives
stop slouching sit up straight and go dork or get your elbows off the table
they all mean the same thing all your parents were saying once prioritize your
spine
you see the thing is as humans we were just born with full range of motion by
chemists esta got Klaine spend time traveling the world and research places
where back pain hardly exists
what she notice was people's spines with a flatter lumbar curvature didn't suffer
from back pain she referred to this as a j-shaped spine and you can see the
difference in the images here between the s-shape spine tour in the Western
world and the j shape spine in people
we're back pain doesn't exist godly states that shape spine is what you see
in Greek statues and in young children university
what she's saying is we're all born with a j-shaped spine
now you may have noticed when young children pick things up from the ground
they drop down into this perfect squat
this kid unlike myself did not need a casting director Nora six-year-old
amazing grace to teach him
this move in fact nobody told him
and no guys he's not exercising this is in fact a pre chair resting human
position but unfortunately as a consequence of our current human
conditioning or our culture this natural resting position is about to be taken
away from this child
he's about to be taught a resting position is in fact a chair and when he
students start school seven hours of his day every day he will be asked to sit in
this quite frankly with a nonhuman position now I didn't even take into
account the amount of hours this kid spends watching
peppa pig
according to the British Chiropractic Association the total number of people
off sick from work with back pain
increase last year by twenty-nine percent from the survey the reason for
back pain was sitting too long in one position so i tried to find a survey
totaling the number of four-year-olds off sick from school with back pain but
would you believe it
I just couldn't find one you see we are more than well aware we are a generation
of sitting on our backside human beings but the specific point i would like to
bring to your attention today is the fitness industry is ignorance of the
spine to have us hooked on task completion time weight and distance
this is for most people measures of improvement and progress
how long can you run for how fast can you run
how much can you lift how many repetitions can you do
how many calories can you burn this list is endless
but they're flawed none of these take into account how you're moving or more
importantly how you once could you see nothing can ever compare or will measure
up against the exquisite movement you had as a free year old
a study in 2012 found that musculoskeletal conditions with the
second greatest cause of disability in the world affecting over 1.7 billion
people worldwide
professor wolf a world leader in health care described suffering from
musculoskeletal disorders and being like a Ferrari without wheels
if you don't have mobility and dexterity
it doesn't matter how healthy the rest of your body is so surely the access to
a healthy physicality is working back towards full range of motion to
understand how your body moves and to be able to function
like a human said simply the ability to move like you once could when you were a
free year old we can and should start relearning how to move from the examples
of children ditching these current measures of time
weight and distance and spend time unraveling restrictions getting back the
movement we actually once had
all that's left is an aspiration of ourselves in the school playground as a
child
able to play and move without fear of injury and using our bodies full
potential and those are the results we are aiming for such as slim physique
tone muscles do come but as a byproduct of moving the body as it's designed to
function best
there's a famous Chinese proverb you are as old as your spine
in all honesty I have more chance teaching penguins how to fly than humans
a better way to sit on a chair with just not designed to do it today I'm going to
leave you have a powerful standing posture in cultures where the j shape
spine exists people's butt muscles engage every time they take a step
it's one reason they have these strong but muscles that support their lower
back to demonstrate how the standing posture works i will need a bit bored in
the participation
sony jewel to be standing so
ok
so please stand with your feet together and facing forwards
now push the heels of the feet against each other
not the toes but the heels keep pushing keep pushing
now hold hold this tension
squeeze I want you to just notice just notice what happens to the glute muscles
as a consequence of pushing the hills together we didn't focus on these
muscles
we focused on a movement this is movement first philosophy which I spoke
of earlier focus on a movement muscles follow soon we move efficiently the body
recruits the right muscles for the job standing here with your heels push
together is now your new stance
actually if I can just get you guys to hold this while I finish my last
paragraph
you might just have to give me a standing ovation by taking a lesson from
my kids self
it took me two years of the age of 32 finally get back my resting position
no no my resting position
maybe we should all take a lesson from market sells we should stop teaching
kids how to sit on their ass
we should lead by example and move like them
thank you
yeah
