whenever you read management books i find that the mostly written by
Europeans and Americans and there's an uncanny resemblance between modern
management and stories from the Bible
so let's look at the law the book of Exodus it speaks of people enslaved who
were denied dignity who were denied freedom were denied resources until the
profit comes along and then he shows the people the vision of the promised land
something that no one has seen and people follow him
they follow him across the sea across the wilderness to find this promised
land and in order to get to the promised land efficiently
you need Commandments rules news and golds and what is the problem that the
Prophet faces on the way to the promised land something which is very common
management
it's called non-compliance and that's how management books are designed think
carefully you begin with the problem statement then you have the vision the
mission
the objective the gold target then you have your tasks your standard operating
procedures your regulations or guidelines your principles and finally
you have the auditors that the internal auditor the external auditor the
government the regulator and you go towards the great promise land called
profit so i asked myself a question if modern management is based on stories
from the Bible good Indian manage beat management be inspired by stories from
the piranhas
for those who don't know put on as the ancient chronicles where the stories
from in dermatology are contained and I found something very surprising
I found not one promised land but three promised lands
yeah the first promised land is scored sweating so it means paradise
why is it called Paradise because there is a Carl called comedy new the fish
fulfilling cow ask for anything and the car will give it to you
there is a to call kar capital stand under the tree ask for anything and you
will get it
there's a jewel quality family hold it in your hand
ask for anything and we'll get it without effort in management language
this is called in finite returned with no investment
so this must be paradise
basically you'll get your salary without going to work
it's a place where hunger is indulged your warrant your desires your needs
anything that you want is satisfied and the king of this land is called india
and he's a prosperous king he sits on elephants and he's happy and is powerful
but swagger is always under siege
there are always wore is happening you see if Raja or a king performs a yo goes
to war in to get insecure and immediately steal the horse
if anasuya is born he runs his father's please killing and if she starts doing
capacity he goes to upset our department and say I'm back will unleash yourself
you see he has everything the wish-fulfilling card wish fulfilling
three the fulfilling jewel but he is insecure so he has everything but he is
insecure
sounds familiar
which brings me to the second the promised land which is kyle ash
it is Mount Kailash it is a mountain of stone covered with snow here
hunger is outgrown its destroyed
now why do I say this but that you have to look at this image very very
carefully
it's this popular street image of collection look at it very carefully in
front you can see a bullshit as well and the opposite that as part of these lion
and the book is not quivering in fear there is no predator that is no prey on
one side you see on top of Kartik air there is a peacock
what does the peacock eat a snake where is the snake around shovels Nick what is
the snake eat it it's a rack where is the rack just above the next to benicia
so there you have a predator a prey predator prey but nobody's afraid why
because hunger has been destroyed
there is no hunger there is no need there is no desire that is no one and
therefore she was always a piece but it was the goddess won't let him be at
peace
see woman power what is the gotta see this is all fine
you are not hungry what about other people hunger what about my children's
hunger you have outgrown hunger but what about other people's hunger and that
brings us to the third promised land which is a record the third promised
land
your mission is reclining on a serpent and is surrounded by affluence and a
bundles
but their prosperity is accompanied with peace
there is also piece here now what has happened what is different over here
it's happy playground it is not a runner boom it's not a battleground
it's around the blue me it's a playground over here
other people's hunger is taken care of
wish to participate with the world engages with the world
he is what he does is he descends and does various rules sometimes as king
sometimes Prince sometimes as a lover sometimes as a priest
this is what the Americans call avatar
yeah
so we have three promised lands which are based on three different beliefs
what is belief belief is subjective truth your truth and my truth and to
understand the belief which underlies these promised land
we have to understand the difference between animal hunger and human hunger
human hunger is different from animal hunger in three ways first quantitative
I'm not just hungry for today's food i'm also happy for tomorrow's food and food
the day after tomorrow and the food after 10 years and the food after when
I'm retiring and food for my children and 10 generations from now so i'm going
to save and save and save and hoard hoard hoard and ensure myself because I
want to be assured of food every day for the rest of my life and even in the
future after that human hunter is also qualitatively different
you're not just hungry for food we are also hungry for status for power for
property
animals have directly but they can't be quit territories to the next generations
we need property that we hold onto and pass on to our children and our
children's children and their children and the third . and most critical point
is because humans have imagination
we also have empty I can be sensitive to your hunger
I can feed your hunger both quantitative and qualitative and that's what makes us
unique and that's what underlies these three promised lands
you see in that believes that my hunger matters
first shiver believes I can outgrow my hunger
krishna says your hunger matters
first the question is which hunger matters for us your hunger on my hunger
in the business world which hunger matters first is the shareholders is
that the employees is the customers the when does the politicians regulators
society environment
who's hunger matters first and ask yourself in a relationship
who's hunger matters first parents are trials husband or wife relative or
stranger
yours or mine and when have you had a happy relationship
ask the question the reticle question to ask ourselves with the nuclear and so
here you see most of us are born in the and we say your hunger only matters if
you satisfy my hunger or if after i have satisfied my hunger
only then your hunger letters and this is how most people are that's how we are
designed but what is celebrated in mythology in the mythology is the idea
of satisfying your hunger so that i can outgrow my hunger and therefore you have
temples not to India you have temples for Vishnu and Shiva
in fact they are seen as two sides of the same coin
hurry and Hera by satisfying your hunger
I'm outgrowing my hunger now this is not a vocabulary
you see in business schools and business books of course this week will be
outgoing hunger that is theoretical it cannot happen
that's the first cynics and give the name is a theoretical air it's meant for
people who are injured hopes not for business oops second silicon if I'm just
going to focus on your hunger then it's a recipe for exploitation because the
moment as a focus on other people's hunger but me
I'll be exploited so it doesn't work it doesn't work so we can improve the hard
Cilic alert which is
there is only one reality and that is my hunger my hunger matters first
that's reality of the only reality and you thought repeatedly this is the only
reality
yes it is reality in the animal kingdom not necessarily in the human Kingdom
we do have the capability of outgrowing our hunger and focusing on other
people's anger which brings me to my gb model using management analytics you
seriously unless you have a model
yeah so I have a model i call it business Sutra which is basically says
as is your belief
so is your behavior so is your business
Jessica choise the sovereign harvest other part
if you believe that my hunger matters first you really create a battleground
and there will be prosperity but no peace
if you believe your hunger matters first then there's a possibility of creating a
playground that i will double where there is prosperity with peace and
statistically you can say which way are the businesses are going right now there
is a possibility a remote possibility about but a possibility nevertheless of
creating prosperity with peace where you focus on other people's hunger
so now ask yourself what is your belief or when you choose your belief you
create your promised land
it can be smug that hunger is indulged it can be Kyle ash where there is no
hunger
it can be very cold where everyone's hunger is satisfied and my hunger is
outgrown
thank you
