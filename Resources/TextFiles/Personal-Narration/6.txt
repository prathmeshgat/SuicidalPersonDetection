amn really excited to be here I kinda wanna tell you a little bit more and the 
clearly say basics because we don't really know anything about my syndrome I was born with this very very rare syndrome that only two other people in the world including myself that we know of half 
basically what this Indian causes that I cannot keenly 
yes 
it just sounds as good as it is dnmt 
I could eat absolutely whatever I want whenever I want 
and haven't really gained any weight 
I'm going to be twenty five in March and I would never weighed over about six 
the four pounds my entire life 
what his thing college I hid light in high heels irony was there but it was a giant pile of Twinkies doughnuts chips skittles and my roommate would say I could hear you at twelve thirty reaching under your bed to get food but I'm like you know what 
it's alright nmsiis because there are benefits to this syndrome there are benefits to not 
being able to gain weight there benefits to being visually impaired there are benefits to being kind of really small 
a lot of people think of the how the world are you saying there's benefits when you can only see out of one eye 
who will always tell you what the benefits are because they're great 
I wear contacts 
contact 
half up 
contact dnmt 
when I wear my reading glasses ha ha prescription 
if somebody is annoying me 
being rude 
stand on my right side dnmt you not even there I don't even know you're standing there 
right now if I say like this I have no clue that there's this whole site who room 
also 
being flown 
I am very willing to volunteer myself 
to go to weight watchers 
god it's you some engine and say hi and Lizzie I will fear poster child 
and nbsp unless I really needed I'll say hi I use this program look how well aware dnmt 
even though there are really amazing things that have come from this and doing their also things that have been very very difficult as you can imagine 
growing up I was raised 
one hundred and fifty percent normally 
when I was my parents first child and when I was four and the doctors told my mum 
your daughter has no amniotic fluid around her 
I don't 
so when I was four and it was a miracle that I came out screening 
the doctors told my parents we just want to warn you expect your daughter to never be able to talk walk crawl think or do anything by herself 
now it's very scary thinking person paying to get 
I think that my parents would say 
well no 
why 
why why are we getting our first child to have all these unknown problems 
that's not what they did 
the first thing I thought the doctor was we want to see her 
and we're going to take her home and left her in research in the best of our abilities 
and that's what they did 
I credit 
pretty much everything that I've done in my life to live here it's my god it's nde and I'm always at home watching 
she is recovering from surgery and she has been the glue that's held our family together and giving industry just seen that she's going through so much because she has this fighting spirit that she's instilled in me 
that I 
I had to still proudly been able to stand by to people and say you know what 
I've had a really difficult life 
but that's okay 
that's okay things have been scary things have been tough 
one of the biggest things that I have to deal with growing up for something that is pretty sure every single one of us in this room is dealt with before 
can you guess what that is 
section to be you guys place dnmt 
fully 
I don't know I think the dnmt 
I sometimes like dnmt 
I had to do pulling a lot but as I said I was raised very normally so when 
started kindergarten I 
absolutely no idea that I looked at 
no clue I couldn't see that I was different from other kids 
I think in that kind of as a big sucker reality for a five year old because I when in school Thursday decked out Pocahontas here I was afraid 
I wouldn't think that fact that look like a turtle shell pigeons bigger than me and I walked up to a little girl I smell better 
she looked up at me like I was a monster like I was the scariest thing she ever seen in her life my first reaction was she's a really rude 
pn I Ellen Plunkett and she's all I'm missing out so I'll just go over here and play with blocks 
our voice dnmt 
I thought the day was going to get better and unfortunately and it's a day kind of got worse and worse and a lot of people just wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with me and I couldn't understand why 
why what did I do 
I incident in my mind I was still really cool kid 
so I had to go home and ask my parents what's wrong with me what did I do why don't they like and they sat me down and they simply the only thing that's different about you is that your smaller than the other kids 
you have this syndrome but it's not going to define who you are 
they said go to school pick your head up smile continue to be yourself 
and people see that you're just like them and so that's what I did 
I want you to think and ask yourself this in your head right now what defines you 
who are you 
is it where you come from is their background is that your friends what is it what defines who you are as a person 
it's making me a very long time to figure out 
what defines me 
for so long I thought would define me was my outer appearance 
I thought that my little tiny legs of my little arms and I will face 
was ugly I thought it was disgusting I hated it when I wake up in the morning I was 
going to middle school and looking and they're getting ready picking 
can I just rather send your mom 
it would make my life so much easier if I could just write it off 
I can look like other kids I wouldn't have to buy clothes and head toward the explorer on it 
I would have to buy stuff that was the dazzle those trying to be like the cool kids 
I wouldn't wish and pray and hope and do whatever I could to pray that I would wake up in the morning I would be different and I wouldn't have to deal with the struggles it's what I wanted every single day and every single day I was disciplined 
I had an amazing amazing support system around me 
who never Kenny who I am there to pick me up if I'm sad 
who are there to laugh with me during the good times and they taught me that even though 
even though I have the syndrome even though things are hard 
I can't let that define the 
my life was put into my hands just like your lives are put into yours 
you are the person in the front seat of your car 
you are the one who decides whether your car goes down a backpack or a good path 
you are the one that decides what defines you 
let me tell you it could be really easy and I mean really hard to figure out what what defines 
there are times where I just get so annoyed and frustrated I don't care what defines me 
when I was in high school I found a video unfortunately that somebody Felicita me labeling me the world's ugliest woman ever four million piece in this video eight seconds long no sound thousands opponents people thing Lizzy 
please 
please just dual world a favor 
put a gun to your head and kill yourself 
think think about that if people did it people do that 
stranger still do this 
I cried my eyes out of course and I was ready to kind of fight back in something kinda clicked in my head and I thought I'm just going to leave it alone 
I kind of started realizing that my life is in my hands I could either 
choose to make this really good or I can choose to make this really bad 
I could either be grateful and open my eyes and realize the things that I do have 
and meet those things that define me 
I can't see out of one eye but I can see out of the other 
I might get sick a lot 
they have really nice hair 
they didn guys are like the best little section right here dnmt 
nndb nndb thinking thinking thinking 
okay so I can be there to see me happy I could choose to kind of be upset with what I have and still kinda complain about it but then I started realizing 
and I got elected people called me a monster defying me and I didn't like the people who said kill it with fire define me 
no 
I'm going to let my goals in my success in my accomplishments be the things that define me not my outer appearance not the fact that I visually impaired 
not the fact that I had the syndrome that nobody knows what it is 
so I tell myself I'm going to work my butt off into whatever I could to make myself better because in my mind 
the best way that I think it back at all those people who made fun of me who teased me who called me unclean called me a monster was to make myself better and to show them you know what 
tell me those negative things I wouldn't turn them around and then he said as a ladder to climb up to Michael's 
that's what I did I told myself I wanted to be a motivational speaker Alan right book graduate college had real family my own career 
eight years later I'm sitting in front of you still doing motivational speaking 
first thing I accomplished it I wanted to write a book 
in a couple weeks 
I will be submitting the manuscript for my third book 
sn 
I wanted to graduate college and I just finished 
college nnj 
beginning a degree 
and getting a degree in communication studies from Texas state university in some markets 
and I have a minor in English I wasn't really tried to use real life experience 
%HESITATION while I was getting my degree in that professes or not having it 
but 
I wanted to have classically male family mail career and family farmers kind of down the line my career part I feel like I'm 
million dollar thick considering the fact that when I decided I wanted to be a motivational speaker I went home I signed her to my laptop went to Google type bid how to be able to see the speaker I'm high even joking 
I work my butt off I use the people who are telling you that I could do this 
to motivate me I use their negativity to light my fire to keep going 
use that 
use that use that negativity that you have in your life to make yourself better because I guarantee you 
guarantee you 
he will win 
now I want to end without asking you again 
I want you to leave here and ask yourself what defines you but remember 
break starts here 
thank you nnj
