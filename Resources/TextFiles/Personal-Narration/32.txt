so when I was growing up there was a song we used to sing on the playground
and it will like this
Tracy and so-and-so sitting in a tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g first comes love then
comes marriage then comes baby in a baby carriage and I'm like okay that's it
that's how you do life that's how you do a relationship
love marriage baby carriage k got it
and then I grab and this is what my life turned out to be
slightly more complicated right
love marriage divorce dry spells of marriage comparin ting another marriage
another device
you get the picture
so if you're good at map and are fast reader what you got there is that I've
been married three times
yeah 3 and divorced and what that supposed to mean is that I am a total
failure at relationships and that is one way to look at it but not the only way
because what I think really happened is that i kept marrying the wrong person
now it's not that I didn't you know it's something I chose bad guys my first two
husbands were amazing men who are now married to wonderful women who aren't me
and my third husband well we're friends on facebook now
so all's well that ends well right after the collapse of my third marriage in
2005
I realized that I have been married everyone in sight except the one person
that I really needed to marry in order to have a great relationship and that
once I marry that person
all of my relationships would be successes
even the failures the so-called failures actually so since we're talking today
about women inventing
i'm going to talk about inventing relationship and what I've found through
a lot of trial and obviously many many many errors to be the thing that has
transformed my life in love and that is this idea of marrying yourself
so what does it mean to marry yourself
it's a big idea is as big as marriage itself except if I could just summarize
it would be that you enter into a relationship with yourself and then you
put a ring on it
in other words you commit to yourself fully and then you build a relationship
with yourself to the point where you realize that your hole right now that
there's no man woman jobs circumstance that can happen to you that's going to
make you more poll because you already are in this changes your life
so what happened by now I'm sure at least some of you are wondering why you
should be listening to a three-time divorce a talk about marriage even to
herself and I understand that
and here's what i have to say about that is that what I've learned and my
experiences is that the places where you have the biggest challenges in your life
become the places where you have the most to get if you do your inner work
I kind of want to say that again the places where you have your biggest
challenges are the places where you have the most again
so let me tell you a little bit about the person i truly needed to marry
myself
I'm from Minneapolis
whoo hit it
my mom was a prostitute and it in an alcoholic she put me in foster care when
I was three months old my dad was a a criminal he was a drug dealer and a pin
with a heart of gold
actually they both have hearts of gold and he spent more or less my full life
in prison and he just got out of prison after his most recent sentence which is
20 years and i spent you know until the age of nine I was in probably two dozen
foster homes and the thing you need to know about the story because there's a
lot of details obviously the thing you need to know is that I came out of that
childhood with one goal
- never be left and the way I was going to do that is that i was going to get
married
that was the way I was going to accomplish that goal so I got married
the first time to a guy I met when I was 17
we got married a couple years later when i was 19 he was a really good guy from a
great family he had an MBA
I mean it was like no it was like marriage material
and you know i was thrilled I was like I have a family
I belong somewhere this is wonderful and then after five years I left him and
then 10 years later I got married again to another wonderful guy who's the
father of mine now 16 year old son
we have a we still have a wonderful relationship he's a really good guy but
after four years I left him too and I'm not proud to say that I did that but in
order to really marry yourself you have to get sometimes very painfully honest
with yourself about what it is he done so I'm not proud of that and then eight
years later I got married again when I was 40 and I was like okay
this feels right ok let me tell you what felt right to a girl who was in 24
posture homes a guy who started to d
after nine months of marriage essentially he started dating a 21 year
old girl once you're like okay
you mean it would be funny if it weren't so tragic you have to have a sense that
that's what you know we're facebook friends
so here i am looking at this person that I just described with the terrible track
record of relationships and I'm like I'm supposed to marry her
like this is the woman you want me to marry and the answer is yes because
here's the deal
the thing about marrying yourself is that it's not just like cohabitating
you're not just going to date for a while and see how it turns out
you are going to do this till death do you part
you're going to take the house so here the vows
number one you're going to marry yourself for richer for porn
this means you're going to love yourself right where you are
you don't say to yourself when you get to the corner of Hollywood and Vine
fennel marry you
you don't say when you lose 10 pounds then I love you and you don't say
if you hadn't married that loser I would love you but since he did
I'm sorry I think it's over
when you marry yourself you walk yourself down that aisle exactly where
you are and paradoxically i found that loving myself exactly where I am is the
only way to get where I'm going number two you're going to marry yourself for
better or for worse
so what this means like most of us are willing to love ourselves for better
I mean share like I'm having a great hair day today
I love me that's not what I'm talking about
mmm
I'm talking about for worse you know like the big life disappointments maybe
you don't own a home you didn't get the career you wanted maybe didn't graduate
from college maybe you didn't get the relationship you wanted
maybe it hasn't turned out maybe fight with your mom maybe you watch too much
reality TV
whatever it is it doesn't matter anymore right
because when you marry yourself you agree to stay with you no matter what
so third you marry yourself in sickness and in health
so what this means is that you forgive yourself for your mistakes
a mistake isn't actually a failure unless you don't learn from it and
unless you don't grow
there's a saying you ask for patience and what you get is a line at the bank
and what that means is that life does not give you what you asked for it gives
you the people places and situations that allow you to develop what you asked
for
and you know the thing is is that if you don't get it right the first time
life will give it to you again haha because life is very generous that way
it's like I didn't get it the first time in the first marriage and I didn't get
it the second time
you know it's like okay maybe the third time I'll get it
so inside that terrible experience of that third marriage I learned something
about in sickness and how and what I learned is how to sit by my own bed side
and how to hold my own hand and how to nurse myself and how to comfort myself
and what I learned is that i am a person that I can count on
last but not least to marry yourself when you marry yourself
it's to have and to hold yourself
so what does it mean to have and to hold well I think it means that you love
yourself the way you want someone else to love you
I had always been going through life like with this sense of lack i had i
felt like i was kind of half a person and that I was missing something and I
went into my relationships hoping to solve this feeling that I had my entire
life that I wasn't whole unless someone loved me and the truth was is that I
wasn't ever going to feel whole
until I learned to love myself so this business of marrying yourself transforms
every area of your life your business family relationships kids social
relationships firms because when you marry yourself this huge thing happens
you become able to love in this whole new way
you become able to love other people right where they are or who they are the
same way you're already loving yourself and of course this is what the world
needs more
so when I married myself and i realized that i already had everything i needed i
started seeing it as my job to basically just light up my little corner of the
world
you know that's my new job because I don't need anything i already have it
so when I take meetings it's all about like how can I help this person achieve
her goal and when i'm in my social communities it's like what can i bring
to this that only I can bring and when I go on dates it's like how can i just
discovered another person maybe for just one hour to call it spring for full
circle because people always ask me about my love life
you know they wanted now and um you know the answer is I'm still working on it
aren't we all
you know so this is where i am right now about three months ago I went on a first
date in about 30 minutes into the day I found myself paying attention not to
whether he liked me but how I felt in his presence
notice that I was like light and happy and joking and as I reflected on the
date afterward I was like wow I got really excited I'm like look this is how
committed I am to myself I'm not even on this date
trying to like get someone to like me you know i'm more interested in how I
feel about me that how he feels about me not because i'm selfish but because the
only relationship i'm ever going to have with another person is the one that I'm
already having with myself just gonna have it with them now so it turned out
he liked me you know and we're still together and it's cool and amazing you
know but like I've been married three times to slow down haha
yeah but the thing is I'm not trying to get security from him through marriage
I'm and God forbid a baby carriage
I am only I'm I'm only here to just be in relationship I'm not dying to hear
the words will you marry need because even though those words are very
powerful and very powerful to person like me
I don't need to hear them from him because I've already heard them from
myself and the way I see it it's like I took myself to the top of a mountain or
maybe to the bottom of the ocean and they got down on one knee and I said
I'll never leave you
and now i'm married to one person I really wanted to be with all alone
myself
yeah
yeah
