we 
doctor Martin Luther king junior 
in the nineteen sixty eight speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement state 
in the end 
we will remember not the words of our enemies 
the silence of our friends 
as a teacher I've internalized with methods 
every day all around us 
the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination 
violence 
genocide and war 
the classroom 
I challenge my students to explore the filing fees in their own lives to poetry 
we work together to fill those spaces 
to recognize 
to name 
to understand that they don't have to be sources of Saint 
in an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing intimacies of their own silences 
I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class 
which every student finds the beginning of the year 
re critically 
right consciously 
speak clearly 
tell your troops 
I find myself thinking a lot about that last point 
tell your troops 
and I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up 
I don't have to tell my truth 
and be honest with them about the times why failed to do so 
so I tell them that growing up 
a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans 
during that 
I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up 
sacrifice something you typically indulgent to prove to god you understand I think to the 
I've given up soda McDonald's French fries French kisses and everything in between 
but one year 
I gave up speaking 
figured most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice but it was like I hadn't realized 
but I had given that up a long time ago 
I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own thoughts sometimes 
just wouldn't say anything 
appeasing ignorance with my silence unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence when Christian with beat up for being gay I put my hands in my pocket and walk with my head down as if I didn't even notice couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I put my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up nearly thirteen point affirmation that he was worth theme of more concern with touching the screen of my apple and actually feeding him one when the woman at the fundraising gala them so proud of you must be so hard to find those poor unintelligent kids I bit my lip because apparently we needed her money what my students needed their dignity we spent so much time 
listening to the things people I think 
that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't 
silence 
if the residue of fear 
spilling your flaws got rich guillotine your tongue into the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel faith in your lungs silence is Rwandan genocide filing it 
Trina it is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left of the found after the noose is already tied it is charming exchange it is privileged if pain there is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision I will tell Christian that he is a lion I think wary of bravery and brilliance I will ask that home with me and what his name is and how his day was because sometimes all people want to be 
human I will tell that woman and my students to talk about transcendentalism like their last name with the row it just because you watch went up at the wire doesn't mean you know anything about my kids so this year 
instead of giving something up 
I will live every day as if it were a microphone tucked under my tongue 
stays on the underside of my ambition 
who have to have a soapbox 
when all you've ever needed 
your voice 
fineness
