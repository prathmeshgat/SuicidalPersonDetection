recording here's the audience
okay about a year ago was probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my
life it was Halloween and my sorority time they got texting and had a party
and for the state party we went to a place called daisy dukes and decided
that we are going to go dancing and handle their friends and all that so we
got there he was already really busy and there was no room for dancing so my date
bread and my friend Kelsey and Stephen tonight I decided to go upstairs and to
go dancing on the balcony because they're less crowded they're just being
more fun easier so as we're going upstairs detective song comes on and
there's really no way to get techno so we kind of were you pulling your hair
and kingdom and I never been the daisy dukes before so we go upstairs and I
didn't know that when there's the balcony there's a step down from the
main area and I have no idea
so I'm falling Brett my date and he's running and I'm calling him running with
my hair in my face
meanwhile and I don't see the step so I run off it and I'll and really hard on
my foot and the first thing that goes through my head is not
wow that hurt it I'm looking an idiot thanks for doing that i decided to be
less embarrassing to throw myself against a wall so I threw myself against
wanna fly down it and it's kind of the room and read and Counting Stephen
always start cracking up like you Andrea oh yeah I'm fine i didn't want to talk
to them about it and they just relaxing and I left you because I knew if I don't
laugh i'm going to pride so i decided to down from and I might just give me a
second to look like but all will be good and I feel like I'd be a bad date if I
just left to that point and i kinda like four guys so we decided to dance to go
back downstairs and i danced for 2 hours on my clit and all the meanwhile my kids
it's really starting to hurt and it's standing and I kept going back with a
friend of mine i look at my foot is coming out of my shoes
yeah so we finally decided to leave and we get back on the bus
that's how we got there and take us back to the mall with my car was parked and
so but i'm in the best for probably 10 to 15 minutes and that's enough time for
me to be off my foot into realize how badly hurt it actually was so that time
I get up and start trying to walk I'm women really bad and relics that mean
keeps acting are you can we are you okay yes I'm fine I just need to sleep some
icon 8 i'm gonna be great
so i take him back home and I get back to master kyle house where I was living
at that point and i can get the stairs i had to have some girls help me up there
and I was gonna finish to test and the paper that was due the next day and it
just didn't happen so that well maybe I can sleep it off so i went to bed and I
didn't sleep at all and woke up
well gotta the next day and had to crawl second walk into getting my assignments
done and with the doctor and after a while I found out that I was broken so
kind of lesson I learned that don't you know when you get injured you should
probably take care of it instead of avoiding it because sometimes you make
it a little bit worse than it has to be so that's my speech and then to prove
that everyone stayed here we go again
