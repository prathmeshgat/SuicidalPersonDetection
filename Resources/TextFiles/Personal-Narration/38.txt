frankly I must say I'm very impressed with the way Mary pronounce my name I
couldn't have said it better myself
about 25 years ago I was in my final year of medical school but I'd been
doubting my career choice for quite some time
then one day I went to take blood from a sweet little old lady struck an artery
instead of a vein
I still don't know how I did there and his blood spurted out all over the place
i said to myself yep
you're definitely in the wrong profession here
so in the interest of all concerned i dropped out a and became a yogi instead
hints my unconventional appearance
well actually it's not the only reason for my unconventional appearance one of
many shall we say so i'd like to share with you the yogic concept of space
our inner space what we experienced within ourselves
I'm redefining the terms a bit here and outer space
everything outside ourselves we live in a vast year this to give you some idea
of its size
if we took the universe to be the size of our planet ears then our planet earth
would be about a billion the size of a pinhead in comparison the billions the
size of one of those i'm holding up the pin in case you can see it
it's my prop
be gay it's the same one hit it actually is the same one
a billion the size of one of those compared to one of those by the way a
billion the size of a pinhead is about a millionth the size of a grain of saying
or about the average size of an atom
so take your pick in any case that the the idea is that it's really really
really small compared to the size of the universe and so does that help put it in
perspective I think that gives us some idea of the size of our universe and
incredibly vast and complex universe which we've been expected to believe
according to modern science appeared out of nothing without any intention behind
it
potentially like expecting us to believe that our phones and laptops just fell
into place without anyone designing them or putting them together
according to biologists root shell drop children
modern science is based on the principle give us one free miracle and will
explain the wrist and the one free miracle is the appearance of all the
matter and energy of the universe and all the laws that govern it from nothing
in a single instant but modern science is just now coming around to the
conclusions held by yogic science for millennia to an explanation of their
universe that that's going to take our understanding to a whole new level and
that is that both the substance and the intention of the universe come from a
deeper reality than the material one we normally perceive with our minds and
senses and that reality is consciousness and all pervading blissful awareness
inherent in everybody and everything
just as your own consciousness is the essence of your own mind
cosmic consciousness is the essence of the entire universe
it exists within everything and everything exists with the net
essentially everybody and everything is part of and full of consciousness
imagine that however we've for reasons I won't go into now we've largely given up
on the idea of higher consciousness in our modern world view in the last
hundred years or so
modern science has come to a very mechanistic take on reality
what if though mind matter and space were all full of consciousness
what if the possibility of consciousness is a higher reality where everybody's
real is any of our current constructs of reality and what if it could give us
if only we were open to it some very real advantages and understanding our
world and where we fit into it
compared to some very serious disadvantages of a materialist field
worldview in a materialist world view of an arbitrary mechanistic unfeeling
universe
there's every reason to feel alienated lonely fearful and depressed and if we
don't feel it ourselves we all too often see it in others and in the Malays of
our society
materialism doesn't engine your optimism in people or society
on the other hand in a blissfully conscious universe
there's every reason to feel inherently connected to people and to the world to
feel loved
hopeful happy and at peace with oneself and others
in the words of my guru Sri and under murti you are never alone or helpless
the force that guides the Stars guide you to
so rather than trying to validate a worldview which makes the said and
fearful of the future I believe we should be trying to validate a worldview
which gives us fulfillment and hope for the future not just as individuals but
as a society the benefits of a conscious world view or amines and it's
potentially no less valid than any of our construction of material reality
this is not just wishful thinking infect the essence of the universe is
consciousness is just as valid premise is the essence of the universe is matter
the only difference is that one can be seen in the other kind
we can perceive matter with their minds and with scientific measurement but we
can only experience consciousness internally we must find it within
ourselves
there was once a Sufi mystic corners Rudin
I actually stayed in his hometown and turkey for a few days once and there are
many stories about how he used to teach in eccentric and humorous ways one of
those stories goes that he lost the key to his house and that he was looking for
it one day outside
one night outside under a street lamp a passerby asked him what he was doing
I'm looking for the key to my house where did you lose it she asked
somewhere inside my house then naturally she said well if you lost it inside your
house
why are you looking for it outside because it's dark inside he replied
we need to look for what we're looking for in the right place
even if it's hard to look for it there it's easy to look outside not so easy to
look within
according to yoga teachings consciousness lies within
and so we must look for it there but here's the catch
not intellectually it's not something we can comprehend with the mind
take the case of a light bulb for example a light bulb is capable of
shining light on the room around it but not on the power which illuminates it in
the same way we're capable of comprehending the world around us but
not the consciousness which animates us
it's beyond the normal functioning of the mind beyond words beyond even
thought itself the core of our being is not something that can even be spoken
about little and thought of I think we're all familiar with the same by date
at I think therefore I am
but this is what yogic philosophy says when I stopped thinking then I really
end just because we can't think of something just because we can't prove
something scientifically doesn't mean it's not there
we can't prove a mother's love for her child but that doesn't mean it's not
there it's a matter of the heart and matters of the heart can't be feather
and by the mind
so material science can never get to the heart of what it really means to be
human
we can only validate the essence of our existence through the deepest internal
experience of awareness within us
well about now you might be thinking that this is all a bit theory theory a
new age
even I'm starting to think of listening to myself
yeah
so I want to give you a few brief examples of scientists that have also
acknowledge the likelihood of consciousness is a higher reality there
are many of them but those that there are a quite distinguished I want to be
in too much time on this in fact or try to finish before i begin next plan
the the father of quantum theory considered coins of consciousness is
fundamental
I regard matter is derivative from consciousness
we cannot get behind consciousness everything that we talked about
everything that we regard as existing postulates consciousness this from the
pioneer of quantum theory a bit later the the physicist james jeans wrote the
stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality the universe
begins to look more like a great thought
then like a great machine and I better throw in something from Einstein here
just to give it a bit more on the most beautiful and profound emotion we can
experience is the sensation of the mystical it is at the root of all true
science that deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning
power which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe is my idea of
God
finally I want to give you an example of a contemporary scientists who actually
experienced high consciousness firsthand
dr. even Alexander is a neuroscientist he had like many of his colleagues
bought into the idea that the brain creates its own consciousness
then quite ironically he contracted a very r brain and fiction which put him
in a coma for a week during which he experienced the heightened enlightened
state of awareness
despite the fact that he was clinically brain dead at the time he said during my
seven days of coma
I not only remained fully conscious but journey to a stunning world of beauty
and peace and unconditional love
I and underwent the most staggering experience of my life
my consciousness traveling to another level dr. Alexander is now on a mission
to convince the brain science community to as he puts it
graduate from kindergarten and and move on from the idea that the brain creates
its own reality
now fortunately for you and I apart from examples such as these
they're just so happens to be a systematic and scientific method of
validating consciousness personally in our everyday lives and I think you won't
be surprised to hear me say that that's going to be a meditation meditation is
intuitional science where consciousness is substantiated by purely firsthand
internal experience through meditation
it's entirely possible to experience higher consciousness as every bit as
real as you and I sitting in this room right now
once i had a military particularly illuminating meditation experience where
I felt the whole room was full of the field of consciousness vibrating with
awareness with bliss
it was so intense so tangible the feeling I had the time was that I could
have cut it with a knife and it was undeniably real then and I still have no
doubt about it to this day
so through meditation one has many such experiences and that ultimately lead to
the
the realization of one consciousness
well why don't we go ahead right now and try to experience higher consciousness
through meditation
so we give it a try
it might not have occurred to you when you wake up this morning that you'd be
meditated today but there you go
anything's possible so i invite you to close your eyes for a minute or so
remember to breathe and try not to fall asleep I know it's been a long day and
start off by centering yourself
focus on your sense of self feel the center of yourself
now feel that you are completely at peace
feel peace and happiness all around you
feel infinite happiness all around you
now feel that you are merging into that infinite happiness
feel that your own sense of awareness is merging into the infinite awareness
around you feel that your own consciousness is merging into the
infinite consciousness all around
feel yourself becoming one with it
feel that you are one with it
feel that you are
and continue like that for a few more seconds
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
now doesn't that feel better
yes
anyway you might have gotten a glimpse just now into the possibility that your
own consciousness is one with the consciousness of the whole universe that
it's within you as well as all around you that it's real and that you can feel
it if you really try and not only feel it but no it is the core of your being
this is not just an abstract concept it's about the essence of us all
it's about discovering the greater consciousness within our own
consciousness realizing our own inner reality is the greater Universal reality
and the more we expand our sense of reality as sense of being the more
connected we feel to all beings the happier we are the less fearful the less
lonely because we realize that all is a part of us and that we are part of all
the inner crease facilitates the embracing of all within ourselves or
people animals plants the planet people animals and plants on other planets yes
it's a no-brainer
the whole universe what i like to say is that just as the world becomes a smaller
place with the development of communication and transport technology
so will the war universe become a smaller place with the development of
meditation technology
thank you
yeah
