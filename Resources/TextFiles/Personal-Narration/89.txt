what do people do some of us make resolutions in 2014
I was writing it I quit smoking
I will get back in shape so I lied only with resolutions we make resolutions
with the whole that things are going to be better
we will do it yes will make things look back
I'm sure those who left and all of us at last know that all of us will make
resolutions were actually stick to it then the book question comes here is the
most of us will make resolutions don't reach our goal
but we have decided apparently what I understood by meeting people by talking
to people
is that what most of us Taylor resolution is nearly all wish list
something which we wish that things out to be true and that is what we call a
resolution to make a resolution with to resolve something and to resolve
something means this is all it is going to be that goes without saying that when
you make a resolution that means that it is something very important to you
either you want to achieve in your ball or you want to reform and all
but even then it is so important to you why was it that it's okay when you don't
reach your little Kevin you don't meet the expectations of the resolution that
you have made
well because most of us have a strong reason to change when we get to make a
resolution
what we think but i'm going to shoot list while should lose weight
I should get back and ship I should get six packs
whoever should list but what we don't have is a must list then we're going to
have been Rihanna shortlist what do we do that if it turns out good blow your
attending great but it's okay if it doesn't you know what we expected it
doesn't turn out to be like that it's okay
but when something is must for you an absolute must
from you either formally or you make away while we need a massless because we
have everything
things are going to be easy well some challenge comes up you might make
necessarily push yourself to reach your goal you will give up you will net get
to be able to joint off and the same applies to people who are obese or
overweight and who wish to reduce with when they're happy when then good move
to change anything life is positive when the button give to them something nice
that isn't that not only lose weight I'm so aggravated I lose it but then the a
little stressed or then be some challenge comes up when they are the
step emotionally
what do they do they just give up well because they don't have a strong reason
to change
they don't have anyone spotting trigger that will make them walk towards the
cool
yes we want to lose weight but they don't have a strong ball
so when people come to me with the intention to lose it
the first question has them is why the one who's with people tell me about them
ok my boyfriend wants me to be 10 and that's why I lose my weight I'm going to
matter whenever two months and my so would be right is a villain is wishing
that al should look good and that then that's what I'll lose with my parents
are searching the ground for me
so they expect me to reduce with my michelle must have seen such people who
lost to it just to get mattered and once they are to the real world of getting
married
they were programming with their old habits and with all read
well with such corporations would not last long
they would ignite or inspire a lasting change
if this is never right away then what is the right way
what will cause the lasting change what should be your reason what should be
over all know by your reason should have a power to permute towards it
that's something that you to push yourself to do because it won't last
long
the two types of motivation what is push and others too much work where's will
bubble and will people might not last fall
what would last is for something that is so exciting
so in spalding that you will do all other pics no matter what to reach your
goal
let me share another story another example with you
there is no other was a female who came to me her it was she was in the early
forties
she told me that I lose weight so like always the first question I last year
was right she told me that I am to play tennis with my 15 year old daughter and
honestly I don't want her to be your weight just like me
I went to them good habits so that i can teach her a good habits and I don't want
her to regret later on but surely wanted was to be a good role model she wanted
to give a better future to her daughter
that was her transformation trigger and
I wanted to mention that yes she did it
and yes she plays tennis with a daughter not anymore story but if you look at any
success with body transformation story
there are few things that we're going to have to be common in all of them member
one but perhaps saw this step
I mean they have a strong reason to change remember to this type of
expecting more from themselves
number three their step accepting the mediocre and number four they raise
their standards will stop accepting the mediocre when you raise your standards
that's when the magic happens to raise the quality of your life you have to
raise your standards
if I said the sounds of what you would expect from yourself the life that you
will accept
hello or whether it meets to at least reach the minimum and that is how your
life will change but if you don't expect anything or if you don't set your
standards what will happen
you might just end up accepting the mediocre lifestyle which might not suit
you
so more and no matter what your goal is to lose weight to gain me to get six
packs all you need to do is find the transformational trigger and raise your
standards
I truly believe this to be true because i have experienced it myself and
goodness is not just a physical process
it's a Maine game well you know I would have seen my video but let me just again
talk about it
how about inspired and how I lost my weight so I like to show you some
pictures
so now that is how you all know that the person in the picture is me and i will
look like that sometimes some years back my wig was 86 deg and people used to
consider me to be more than my age
and you already know that it's when i was with my niece somebody told me that
he has him to be her mother and he told me that how your daughter is very cute
I'll show up for a moment I was made to ever pay when but good looking well
he came to me and he told me that you're always very cute
okay seriously and that made we prove that it's high time you do something
it came to me I was hot I don't like it because i was with my friends and this
blog
very nice looking at comes to me and tells me that your daughter is really
cure than I don't go for college for a week
that's the report that they only the inspiration trigger that give me my
transformation trigger that
yes you should change right because I couldn't accept and accept that and so i
decided i should change and then I when I was fat
I'm going Lee my standards of what I expected from myself my standards of her
before me for very low
I realize that this is not who I am
I decider but I don't change I don't lose my rate / foot
I'll be strong and back to all my life and I last 33 G of my feet in the
spanish for Nia about any people's surgeries or chris writing classes i
think most very very few rid of most of the people while trying to lose it
I didn't do that and it really changed my life because what i did was i use a
combination of right
eating that is balanced style cardio and strength training is in every single
solution but mrs. something so much more beyond just eating right and exercising
more
it is a catalyst for positive change and it best match every aspect of your life
so I was added that we should all give this beautiful experience just myself
and
so i made a video called how last 33 kg in one and put it on youtube
what I wanted to do was I want to show the world but yes you can do it if an
ordinary person like me can do it you can do it too if i can do it you can do
it too
that with back purpose i made this video and i put it online
I wanted to show other people that it's really easy to lose weight if you know
how to do it and my a new social media are very very actively to reach out to
people to be in touch with people so bad even they can reduce with steph it be
strong and I'm glad to share that my video has been viewed more than women
times on YouTube but people all across the world and i'm highly could I mean
very active and very much connected to people through his work through social
media through i make regular videos so that I can help people reach their goal
they should not face up stickers it all faced because i wasn't aware of many
things that how you should lose weight
what sort of for that you should follow and what sort of what is the role of
exercise and all
so what I'm trying to do is I'm using social media because number one social
media is a free platform and we all know that all of us are also very active on
social media use it for multiple reasons and I thought to myself that instead of
all the money by opening my own gym or something
whenever I uses free platform and reach out to people so that they should not be
as the problems it I'll feast this year maybe is this would make complain that
ok i don't have any support and help
I'm not able to lose weight I don't care everybody to guide me because it's not
always that you see we all know we are living in a world of information or Lord
will know how to do it but then you also need a friend to tell you that I'm there
with you just go ahead you're going right and that's the rule that i'm
planning to do animals to a 30 rise of thousands on developmental newspaper
opposed the articles even on facebook so that it reaches too many people i make
videos on you do to reach out to people also conduct free seminars all across
india to reach out to people tell them that it is possible and how to do it
this is my small effort by using social media to reach i am connected to all one
that people on facebook what I found out one comment in all the places that we
want to grow
how to progress it's just that we need someone to tell us that this is how to
do it and yes i am there for you
so I'm trying to bridge the gap between knowledge and somebody watching your
back
that's what I'm trying to do and i strongly believe that only false has a
super hero within us
it's just that we need to raise the standards and strive to exceed it was
not about being bested everything
it's about being best at being you
we all have our identity attached to something and we love battery room if I
believe that you are lazy
you will add that way if you believe that you are then sugar addict
then you will create sugar and no matter what you will not be able to control
yourself if you believe that you're all of it
you follow all the standards that will keep you all of it
if you believe that yes I am foot yes I am strong
you will make and you will follow all the standards that we make your foot and
strong
we live who believe we are and that's how it works
if you look at your parents self if you look at your parent body shape foreign
body size color and physical body
it is a reflection of only wanting not your boys master desires but your
standards your physical body today is a reflection of the identity
you have for yourself so my message for you today is that I understand that we
live in a time where we have no responsibilities
bubbling multiple rules are so many students risk but all that said in them
you have to make your fitness a priority
you have to make your fitness and missed for you
what's something that when you're in good mood you child other resolutions
and you been decided to go to it
no we have to make the best for you whether we lose weight gain with muscles
gets expects whatever go maybe the fam to yourself who you are and work towards
that
let's set the standards better moving will if you set your standards to remove
the angle group
move over you're moving went to home time you will have time you will find
time because your standards will 12 different energy towards it
so all we have to do is raise your standards
thank you
