mtn nnj ndz though 
so I want to start off with 
a few questions 
well 
and I know a lot of other presenters have already asked you questions 
and they've been kind of 
hard questions but the questions I'm going to ask you 
a very very simple 
and I promise you'll be able to answer these 
are you ready for your first one 
okay 
your first question is 
you don't have to answer out loud 
are you having a good day 
okay gotten into 
alright 
my second question for you is 
why 
if you're having a good day 
why are you having a good day 
or if you're having a bad day 
why are you having a bad day 
so I have one more question for you 
this should be the easiest one of our 
my last question is 
tomorrow 
would you rather have a good day 
or would you rather have 
a bad day 
Jerry answer for that one 
what about the day after tomorrow about Sunday 
the seat that's right thrown Saturday Sunday 
how about Monday 
would you like to have a good day or a bad 
on Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday Thursday Friday 
this time next week good there that 
so that last question 
like I said is probably the easiest one for us to answer 
because we know the answer to that don't 
when I have a good day everyday 
did anyone in the room answer yes I wanna have a bad day on Monday 
of course none will when I have a good day everyday 
so this is really speaking to the type of happiness 
that we all wish for 
in our heart of hearts 
we have a good day 
when we are happy 
and we want to be happy everyday 
there's never a day when we don't want to be happy 
but whether or not we have good days and bad days really depends upon how we answered 
the second question 
their number the second question 
what was the second question 
while I 
why am I having a good day 
why am I having a bad day 
so one thing that my teacher sends his name is get chic hustling Joxer 
and he says son 
much of the time 
I'm mine dislike 
a balloon in the wind 
baloney here and there 
by external circumstances 
do you know that feeling 
he says when things are going well 
when they're going our way 
we feel happy 
but then if something goes wrong 
for example he says if we're forced 
to work with a colleague that we dislike 
but I'm sure none of you have colleagues who dislike cry 
he says if we are forced to work with someone we dislike or if something doesn't go our way than are happy feeling disappears 
so as long as her answer to the question why am I having a good day why am I having a bad day because you know this is a question people ask us like maybe when you get home today 
someone will go well so how is that Ted thing 
did you have a good day 
I will say yeah yeah I did there is this lady and she talked to us about how we need to be about compassionate towards former inmates and 
there is this performer who did this awesome be boxing thing with his mouth and you know this person and that person 
as long as our reasons 
for why we had a good day our list 
of external conditions 
then we're not going 
to have the stable happiness 
that we all want 
does it make sense to you 
because of us what our happiness depends upon 
because we cannot control 
people and circumstances 
every single day 
then our happiness will be in the hands of others Ronan 
it'll be at the whim of our circumstances 
so if you really wish to have a good day everyday we've got two things we need to do 
so the first thing that we need to do is we need to stop 
mb 
out sourcing 
our happiness 
an outsourcing our unhappiness 
on the people and circumstances 
in other words 
we need to stop attributing our happiness 
to what's going on externally 
and we need to stop 
blaming others 
specially blaming others 
for our unhappiness 
so for as long as we do that as long as we're making it the job 
of people and circumstances 
to make us happy 
or as long as we're making it their fault when were unhappy 
our happiness will be very unstable 
and allusive 
our second job 
is to actively cultivate 
a source of peace and a source of happiness 
coming from inside 
our own mind 
so here's something I want you to commit to memory 
are you ready 
this is another line on 
from one of my teachers perks where his sons 
happiness 
and unhappiness 
our states of mind 
and therefore 
they're real causes 
cannot be found 
outside the mind 
so if we had a peaceful state of mind 
we will be happy 
regardless 
of people and circumstances 
if our mind is on peaceful agitated 
then even if we are very good circumstances 
will find it impossible to be happy 
so in other words 
it's not 
what is happening 
that is making us happy or unhappy 
it is how we are responding 
to those things 
that determines whether we are happy or unhappy 
it is what our state of mind is supplying 
that determines our happiness or unhappiness 
so how are we going to do this 
so we can all understand this I intellectually it's not rocket science is it is not hard to understand and maybe to a certain extent %HESITATION as high style you these things really got yeah I knew that already 
I knew that already 
how we actually do it how do we actually cultivate 
this 
stable peace of mind that we can rely upon 
regardless of the external circumstances 
so this is really where meditation comes and plan 
and 
I would say I would need a whole nother Ted talk 
hint hint 
%HESITATION 
in order to really do the subject of meditation justice 
but 
for our purposes today we can say that meditation is a mental action 
it's the mental action of concentrated 
on a peaceful positive state of mind 
if we do that 
concentrated 
on a peaceful positive state of mind 
and we can say were meditating 
whether that Sonny Vince right 
see actually I don't know if I'm meditating or not because I could be thinking about my grocery list 
it's only meditation if I'm actually focusing on a positive peaceful state of mind 
the trick is I can do it like this 
this is called formal meditation 
we can also learn to do this all the time in our daily life 
sissy here's a perfect opportunity 
we concentrate on a mind of patients 
we're not to stir not unhappy 
so why don't we try it now are you up to up for it just a short meditation according to the clock I've got three minutes left 
so it's going to be a very brief one 
but less actually tryin let's try 
to tap into 
our own potential for a peaceful positive state of mind 
so now I'll ask you just to sit comfortably 
and place your feet flat on the floor 
and your hands within your last 
and then you can lie close your eyes 
and become aware 
the sensation of your bra 
at the tip of your nerves 
and as you breathe out 
you can a mansion 
you are grieving out 
in agitation 
in a mental busyness 
and their frustration or unhappiness in your life 
breathing it all out 
like dark smoke 
and as you breathe and 
you can a mansion and Billy 
but you are breathing and I could hear 
bright light 
which is a very nature 
of inner impedes 
and you can imagine that this clear bright line 
fills your entire body 
and mind 
and for a few seconds 
simply enjoy 
the centerpiece coming from within 
and now his wife and then 
just be determined 
to bring the centerpiece with you 
and the rest of your day 
to benefit yourself 
and others 
so now Iran's premeditation 
thank you very much
