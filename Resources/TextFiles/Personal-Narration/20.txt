where in the world is it easiest to get rich
that's the question i asked my professor when I studied sociology in the early
nineties because he was having a lecture about social democracies can even
welfare state and he was a classical left-wing sociology professor and he
could not hide his enthusiasm when it talked about these military ins
societies with no rich people and no people but I on the other hand i was
writing my master thesis about rich people
so my when i interviewed my informants from the upper classes they all said the
same thing
life in skinny Naevia is tough
we have to work twice as hard to earn money because we have to struggle
against high taxes strong unions controlling the wages and a generous
welfare state that makes people lazy as one which guy told me he said they call
it a social security net
well a call it a hammock
and as every aspiring social scientists I had starting to go native
I started to feel sympathy for this which people and that's why I raised my
hand and asked by Professor well what if you don't care so much about equality
what if your dream is to become rich
where in the world should i have been born to become really rich i still
remember the possible look on my professors face but he answered the best
he could
something like well if that's your goal in life you should probably have been
born in a society with the free markets low taxes and minimal government
intervention and he added
if you want to become rich you should probably not study sociology and that
was a good answer and the the best guess we had back then
that is until I saw that the university of oslo professor in economy column
woman actually had check the facts
where in the world it's easiest to get rich and before I share with you where
you should go to earn money
we have to define rich the UN talks about the poverty line
you know if you earn less than one dollar a day maybe two dollars a day but
we have to define the richness line some more fun line actually and the most
reliable report when it comes to reach people
The Wealth Report they set the richness line at individuals with net worth more
than 30 million u.s. dollars and in the consultants are going these people are
called uhmw is that is ultra high net worth individuals
Alaska that guy by the ways is not rich it's just a model
yeah
actually on the lower part of the model
all right and I say some money about keeping the watermark there as well
smart
so according to the wealth report
there are a more than 170,000 uhmw is in the world and here's the top 5 list of
countries with the most rich people number five
china with more than 8,000 UK Germany Japan and on top of course
united states with more than 40,000 which people but of course we're not
interested in the absolute numbers here we are interested in which people per
capita per million inhabitants and if we leave out the Pew tax havens like Cyprus
and Switzerland hong kong singapore monaco you have an artificially you
share of rich people
it turns out that we have on number five denmark with 179 reach people per
million inhabitants canada new zealand Sweden and the top
norway
but where's the US
I'm place 13
so what happened to my old professors you know social democracies are no rich
people there but ok
30 million dollars that just pocket money in a country like the US where
people can get insanely rich got the watermark and
so let's rise the richness line up from 30 million dollars up to 1 billion
dollars and the the most reliable source here is the forbes billionaires list and
according to the Forbes
if you look at the owners per million inhabitants on number five Germany 1.2
million billionaires no 1.2 billion as per million inhabitants United States
1.7 Norway to Sweden and on top is done with 3.1 with a single billionaire for
bugle song
he could have been a model so but the point is United States 1.7 Scandinavia
taken as a whole 2.1 and the big mystery is how can this be
how can Bernie Sanders dream societies these socialist prioritizes be such a
breeding place for rich people
that's a mystery and there are two reasons
reason number one is free education social democracies give free higher
education to everybody and cheap student loans and grants and we can that enables
more people to use the talents and earn money we can see this in the social
mobility numbers
imagine all fathers in a society and we divided them into five groups based on
income from the bottom fifth of the top 5th and then we look at their sons and
then divide their income into five steps and we see how many sons of the father's
from the bottom income and up on top
how many sons goes from rags to riches
if it was perfect social mobility
if talents and opportunities were equally distributed twenty percent from
the bottom with end up on each of these five letters
so let's look at the numbers for the different countries in Denmark they're
pretty close to social perfect social mobility with fourteen percent goes from
rags to riches in Norway 12 sweden 11 United States eight
because of free education there are more self made man in Scandinavia done in the
US and if we look at those sons
we don't end up on top but stay on the bottom
it goes from rags to rags again twenty percent would be perfect
mobility in Denmark 25-percent ends up on the on the bottom
sweden bit more norway the United States
this is because education in the United States is very expensive but the second
and most important explanation for skin avia being such a breeding place for
rich people
is this have you ever noticed if you've been the to the United States when you
drive around and you drive through a Toler told plaza
there's actually people sitting there taking your money
compare that to my local toll plaza just a sign with some gizmo attached to it
and when you go to a supermarket united states there are actually people there
helping to pack your things into your bags
it's very friendly and convenient compared to my local grocery store like
this
nobody there
and the biggest shock i had when i went to the US for the first time when i went
to the restroom
there are actually people working there compare that to my local public toilet
it's not even a cleaner there
it cleans itself automatically and the reason for this difference is that skin
even unions are pressing up the minimum wages so it's so expensive to have these
people working there in Norway tollbooth operator supermarket the packer and a
restroom janitor with earn almost 3 as much as in the US and that's why we have
replaced these people with machines and that is why I was surprised when I saw
this article in the new york times in 2014
preparing for Chip and PIN cards in the United States because the United States
people are still using paper checks as a method of payment while skin even banks
I made us start using Chip and PIN cards long ago because the minimum wages here
are so high so skinny navin banks can't afford having people manually
controlling the checks so skin even companies because of the union's
pressing up the wages they have to downsize and introduce new technology or
else they will go broke and new technology increases the productivity in
a society which in the long run
also increases profit and on the upper and all the weights ladder in the name
of solidarity skin even unions hold back the highest salaries of the skilled
workers
so for example and the witching
senior engineer is my uncle by the way
last one there's no watermark there
actually you would look cooler with a more watermark but he earns on average
per year seventy six thousand dollars while his American colleague earns more
than one hundred thousand dollars so American engineers emerged you
they are not only more good looking but there are more expensive so of course
this waitress trained on high skilled work
it's good for profit so the unions are in effect subsidizing the capitalists
I wish I knew all this when i gave up a career in social science because the
beauty and the irony of this finding
I think it's amazing on the one hand you have my rich informants that complain
about how hard it is to get rich in Scandinavia and they had it all wrong
not only is it easier to get rich in a social democracy but there are critical
to the very institutions that have helped them getting which high taxes
it gives free education and more talent into the economy strong unions that are
helping increasing the productivity and the generous welfare state that make the
units except don't sizing because they know that their members will be well
taken care of so the union's cooperate because of the safety net so rich people
are a bit like 'mom accounts famous bird who thinks she could fly even faster in
air less space for getting that it's the air itself that gives her lift and on
the other part of the political spectrum when Bernie Sanders is praising
skin even societies he forgets that these are not anti rich or anti
capitalist systems because the welfare state and unions work in tandem with
capitalist dynamics and I think that is the most important lesson here
the economy is not a zero-sum game
we're in this together and that is why
scandinavia is a better place to fulfill the american dream that America itself
thank you so much
yeah
yeah
