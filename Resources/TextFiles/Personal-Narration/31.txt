yeah
this is all of the trash that I produced in the past three years
when I say that people think that I'm crazy or that I'm lying or they'll ask
me questions like hey so how do you wipe your butt
I live a zero-waste lifestyle and i have for the past three years now
zero waste that's a pretty big idea right so let me define it for you to me
living zero-waste means that I don't make any trash
so no sending anything to landfill know sending anything in a garbage can and no
spitting them on the ground and walking away right
no trash this is a big concept and this all started when I was an environmental
study student at NYU my senior year I was taking a course called the
environmental studies capstone course which is essentially the culminating
course that all environmental study students need to take in order to go out
into the world and make it a more sustainable place
well there was a girl in this class and every class you would have this big
plastic bag with a plastic clamshell full of food a plastic fork and knife a
plastic water bottle in a plastic bag of chips and she would eat all of this and
then class after class would just throw it in the trash
now this is really frustrating because here we were these environmental study
students trying to make the world a better place and there she was throwing
all this stuff into the garbage
one day after class feeling still particularly upset about watching her
throw everything away
I went home to make dinner and I open my fridge and notice something that I had
never seen before
every single thing in my fridge was in one way or another
packaged in plastic and I couldn't believe it
you know I was getting so mad at this girl for making so much plastic trash
and it turns out that i was just as bad
I was that girl and so I made a decision in that moment I was going to stop using
plastic
well quitting plastic
not so easy of the thing right when you think about your everyday life
you wake up in the morning you go into the bathroom and you brush your teeth
what is your toothbrush made out of plastic
what is your toothpaste probably packaged in your face wash your
moisturizer your contact solution so many things that are in our everyday
lives come packaged in plastic and so I realized that if I was going to move
away from plastic the only way that i was going to be able to do that was to
learn how to make my products myself
well i don't know about you but I certainly didn't know how to make
deuteron didn't have the recipe just kind of hanging out in my back pocket
and so I realized that I had to do some research and while i was doing research
online I came across a blog called the zero-waste home started by a woman named
Fayed Johnson who is a wife and mother of two kids out in Mill Valley
California and the four of them live completely zero-waste life when I
learned about pee on her family
my mind was completely blown
I thought that I was doing the best thing that I could for the planet by not
using any plastic but the idea that i didn't have to produce any trash was so
empowering and so inspiring and it made perfect sense right because i was this
environmental studies student
I cared about the environment studied sustainability talked about
sustainability protested for sustainability but I realized that I
wasn't actually implementing any of those values into my day-to-day life and
so I made the decision to go to zero waste so let me break it down for you
and tell you about some of the things that I did in order to make this
transition a little easier
the first thing that I did was I stopped buying packaged food
so instead of going into the store and buying things package and paper and
glass and plastic
I started bringing my own jars and bags to the store to fill with bulk or
package free items i also started buying my fruit and vegetables from the farmers
market
so package free it's that the second thing that I started doing was I started
making all of my own products before i started living this lifestyle
my boyfriend at the time used to Russia's keep using baking soda and I
thought he was probably the grossest person in the entire world right
there's no way that you could possibly get your teeth cleaned using something
like baking soda it's goes well fast forward and it turns out that the first
product that i made was toothpaste made with baking soda
so over time I started making all of my own products
when I would run out of something instead of going to the store and buying
a new one
I would learn how to make it myself so when I would run out of lotion and
learned how to make it myself
run out of deodorant learn how to make it myself over time
all of the things that I had previously purchased for now once that i made
myself
the third thing that I started doing was shopping second hand
so instead of buying new clothing and putting new waste into the way cycle i
would buy things that we're totally recycled second hand so not making any
new trash
the fourth thing that i did was i downsized
so I focused on having only the things that were truly necessary and that I
really needed
well this was really really hard because I'm the kind of person is really
sentimental and i can tell you as to why a toothpick needs to be in my life but
after I really got through that process and I completely downsized i realized
that i had so many fewer things in my life
my home was less cluttered and everything was easier to clean
and when you have fewer things you realize that you take better care of
them right so when you take better care of your things you don't have this
mentality like oh if I don't want this anymore i'll just throw it out and get a
new thing later
no I only had a few things and so I took care of that
and wasn't sending anything to landfill all this must sound pretty difficult
right
I assure you it's not that hard I'm just an average lazy person and I would have
lived this lifestyle
if it was difficult in fact the benefits of living this lifestyle far outweigh
any of the negatives that you can imagine the first benefit is that I save
money so I save money when I buy my food and the products and when I make my own
product because i'm not paying for the embedded cost of packaging so things are
cheaper
i'm also saving money by shopping completely second hand because
secondhand clothing is usually less expensive
the new clothing i'm also saving money because I've downsized and so I don't go
shopping all the time now and you know just buy things on impulse
I only have what i really need the second benefit is that I eat better when
I go shopping now I don't have the option to buy processed food products
packaged free and so now my diet consists of things like fresh fruit and
vegetables or bulk you know grains and not that i buy with my jars in my bags
and so when you get better you feel better
I've noticed that over these past few years
my weight has stabilized I have more energy I need less sleep and when you're
eating better and you feel better and you save money
you're happier but besides those things and happier because for the first time
in my life I'm living in direct alignment with my values and why is this
important right
waste well waste is a really big problem in fact the average American person
produces approximately 4.4 pounds of trash per person per day over the course
of a year
that's like taking eight and a half of your best friends and throwing them in
the trash
don't do that it's not nice
so if you care about your friends and you don't want to throw them away
and you think that it's possible for you to possibly reduce how much trash for
producing i have three simple steps for you
the first step is to actually look at your trash and understand what it is
because you can't solve a problem of having a lot of waste until you know
what it so when i did this exercise i realized that i had three main sources
of trash
the first was food packaging and so I learned how to shop in bulk or package
free
the second was product packaging and so I learned how to make all my own
products and the third was organic food waste and so I learned how to compost
and just by identifying those three sources of waste and eliminating them
I had reduced my trash by about ninety percent
the second thing that I like to suggest is picking at the low-hanging fruit
so doing little things one time changes in your everyday life that have a large
scale and long-term positive impact
this includes things like using a reusable bag instead of a plastic or
paper bag or using a stainless steel or glass water bottle instead of buying
plastic water bottles over the course of know however long you realize that these
little changes actually add up and make a big difference
the third thing that I like to suggest is the DIY or actually learning how to
make your products yourself
now I absolutely love doing this because when you go to a store and you have to
buy products
you kind of have to settle and accept them as they are right
if you don't like the way they smell too bad
if you don't like the way they feel sorry if you don't like what they're
packaged in you don't have a choice
but for me since I make all my own products if I don't like the way they
smell
I change the scent if I don't like the ingredients in them
I change it if I don't like the packaging it's my choice and so by
making my own products I have complete control over what I'm putting in my body
now I started living this lifestyle
while i was still in college
and when I graduated I had a real job a real-person job in sustainability which
is exactly what you think I want to be doing right
well at the same time I was still running my blog trashes for tossers
and I noticed that I was getting recurring question and it was something
like this
dear lauren i absolutely love the products that you're making and I too
want truly natural products but because of life
family friends blah blah blah blah blah I just don't have time to make them
myself
do you have any products that i can go out and buy that are equivalent
thanks for your help lots of love person X Y Z so i went to stores and I started
looking at products and while i found that they were beauty products that were
reminiscent of the ones that I was making myself
I didn't notice the same trend for cleaning products
when I looked at the ingredients of cleaning products even that natural
cleaning products contained ingredients that will really harmful things that
were carcinogenic and endocrine disruptive you know when I looked into
it further
I learned that cleaning product manufacturers aren't even legally
required to disclose the ingredients of their products on the product packaging
and so many when we go and buy a product
we're at the complete mercy of the company hoping that they have our best
interest in mind
I feel that we as consumers have a right to products that are transparent and
that aren't bad for us and so I started thinking about my own products
the ones that i've been making for years that are safe and effective and have
ingredients that I used to do things like brush my teeth or make salad
dressing and i realized that i had an opportunity and so I quit my job and
started a company because i feel like we as human beings have a right to products
that are safe for our homes and our bodies and the environment
I get comments all the time that I'm doing this for attention but I live this
lifestyle for myself I would never tell anyone how to live or how much trash
that they should produce
I just want to provide tools through my blog and my business for people who like
me want to reduce how much trash they're producing I live a zero-waste lifestyle
because to me it's the best way I know how to live a life that aligns with
everything that I believe in
and what's the point right I'm just one person
what difference can I make the point is simple
I want to be remembered for the things that I did while I was on this planet
and not for the trash that I left behind
thank you
