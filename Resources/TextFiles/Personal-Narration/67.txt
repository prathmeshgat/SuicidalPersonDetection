you know I've never understood how um imagining the audience naked was
supposed to make you less nervous honestly I'm just uncomfortable right
now especially with mr. Wardle I'm okay to ensure clear communication with this
social media generation hashtags and pop culture references will be used
hashtag you're welcome good afternoon ladies and gentlemen today is an
exciting day today I'm going to give you a speech now graduates
I don't know if you know me but I'm chase we went to high school together
that's good times follow me on Twitter and I want to the big congratulations to
everyone including myself for being here today
the world we live in is played with dangers Ebola Isis global warming facial
acne and despite all the odds we still managed to graduate so let's give us a
big round of applause
yeah
there's only three years ago that we came to the labyrinth known as we behind
as young team and sophomores we found ourselves lost its halls like they were
the changing staircases of Hogwarts we danced to lyrics we did not understand
and the song dumb style
we said yellow and Craig pray as if we were supposed to then
thank goodness we have each now we have dissipated are cataclysmic doom at the
end of 2012
and back then we were high school had no windows oh wait it still doesn't
I know I know it's a clich√© joke but it was still necessary
hashtag sorry not sorry no nervous is sophomores we started getting the hang
of things in junior year for many of us brought experience and for many more of
us immense stage 1 senioritis and now here we are done with high school as
Charles Dickens put it it was the best of times it was the worst of times but
now we are here with a stressful base of a pea in a CT testing we've raised tens
of thousands of dollars the courts and cans and inhaled hundreds of pounds of
baby powder during football
we have survived whs screenshots and last but not least we have realized that
we are the most attractive class ever
yeah
as our student body president michael meyer has observed quote one might say
we've aged well
and now with seniors listening to me deliver this brilliant graduation speech
we are through afflicted and overwhelmed with senioritis now at the end of our
careers of students we have an opportunity now is our time to take on
the world and find the pursuer passions to quote unquote leave a legacy
William Shakespeare and also Channing Tatum once said some are born great some
achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them in life we
can always care about being born great for having greatness thrust upon us but
always always remember that the opportunity to achieve greatness is
within our grasp
keep in mind that many of our social and political leaders and heroes started
their lives as an average person has just one of you and me
despite the failures in the States we will make and although we may be average
we find that the average can achieve greatness whether recognized by the
world or just a few greatness comes from our friends reaching out to us
those who go out of their way to be thoughtful the unsung heroes if there's
anything you take from today remember that to leave a legacy and she would
achieve greater this is not to get money and recognition is to leave those with
whom you cross paths with a little more happiness and hope our time here
together as a senior class would not be remembered by grades popularity lights
or favorites but by relationships
the kind of person you were these are legacies the kind of musty class of 2015
it's been a hashtag splendid three years with you and from the bottom of my heart
that was
you all very very very much thank you
