thank you guys for coming today
my name is Larry Cole and the title of this speech is called any bag will do
and it's a self introduction speech the background I've chosen for today is just
a pretty typical all-around utility bag i use this everyday student and so I
used school it's got all kinds of pockets and everything and I always keep
pencils and i even have tissues and lipgloss full of name cards with my
phone number and stuff and so that's why choose chosen this bag
samsung children and this is deep and carries a lot of things i have some
objects here to represent my past present and future and we'll start with
my past one of the objects that i have is a picture of my family from the
reason that i have this pictures because I grew up with a very close-knit family
my parents were always telling us how important it is to be nice to your
family obviously be close with your siblings and of course they were right
because now I'm older and my mom and forests and five years and we have this
bottle is growing up of course now we're really close friends and all this
friends another object that I have to represent my pass is about called jesus
calling and this is just one of my favorite devotions my parents brought us
up in a very conservative Christian we were taught at a young age how important
God and faith that i was talking to develop during those early years has
definitely played a role in my life all the way up to this point now another
object that I have to represent
asked is the cat wearing US Marine Corps address pls blouse and the reason this
is important and civilized a lot about my past is my husband was a marine when
he joined the Marine Corps when I was 20 years old and he was 22 and we spent 10
years traveling in the braincore we spent four years in California and four
years in north carolina north carolina in California we made tons of friends
from all over the world and that to this day and played a very very important
role in our lives
some of the objects that I have to represent my present are a picture of my
family
obviously my family is very important to me and these are two of the biggest
roles that I play as a wife and mom I've been a stay-at-home mom for about 14
years now and I've enjoyed that growing up
honestly that's really all I wanted to do was to be a stay-at-home mom and have
children and be able to take care of my husband and my family and I've been very
fortunate to be able to do that and even now I still continue to do that as also
pursuing my degree in school
another thing that I have to represent my present is my kindle i use this a lot
and I'm a big reader i did not grow up a reader i was not a very student student
growing up either and I like to play growing up but now reading is a huge
part of my life i only learned to love reading as an adult and I read a lot and
allowed to read another object that I have to represent a present is
passport my family and I grew up traveling my husband was a history maker
my father was a history major and so we grew up traveling the United States and
seeing many many places and of course i'm only learned to appreciate this
places as an adult now and we've been fortunate enough with a small part time
job that I have at home that works with exchange students to meet tons of people
from all over the world in Spanish walks Bahamas is a place that we like to go in
the summer to just relax and leisure and then two of my favorite places that
we've traveled are England and then Germany of course with all the history
there that we that I like so much
another object that I have for my present is a spiral notebook and all of
these students will know that how important this is
I have a bunch of these but i am the student now at malo and I've been a
full-time student from the past two years and played a huge role in
everything I do every day and follow some of the objects that I have to
represent my path for my future I have an apple
I'm going to school to be a teacher and I know how hard being a teenager is even
today when I see teenagers and the struggle through i really look forward
to being a high school teacher I want to teach history and spanish and I just
hope that one day I can make a difference in the lives of some of the
teenagers like some people made in my life when I was a teenager
another object that I have to represent my future in sippy cup
I've been fortunate enough like I said to stay home with my children and their
13 and 11 now and my 11 year old has some special needs and we really really
always wanted to have more children but we just kind of waited to give us a
little bit more older and a little bit
easier to take care of and so I really hope that in the future that we can help
to complete our family whether that be having more children are adopting more
children
that's just a little bit about me a little bit about my past present and
future
thank you
