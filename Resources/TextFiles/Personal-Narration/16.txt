the day I got laid off from my job at Martha Stewart I was relieved 
I love the job I really did but the relationship was over and I didn't know how to end it 
and then I broke up with me 
eleven that haven't 
at the time I been also hosting a radio show for the Martha Stewart brand on SiriusXM and then not long after that got canceled too 
on the day of my last show I got onto the elevator at the thirty sixth floor and as it started to drop 
I started to cry 
every floor took me further and further from what I had been 
a magazine editor radio host 
a person with a cool job to talk about at parties 
you know 
and honestly I had no idea what I was going to do and quite frankly no one was looking for me 
so I did what anyone would do in that situation I was making some phone calls he what are you up to dimension I'm available 
her off I needed to get paid to do something right I mean I live in New York City if you're not paid to do something you're not going to be there very long 
but this idea that I had to know what I was supposed to do now freedoms was to pursue this passion 
it just bugged me it always had 
and it's because there's a dangerously limiting idea at the heart of everything we believe about success and life in general 
and it's that you have won the singular passion and your job is to find it 
and to pursue it to the exclusion of all else 
if you do that everything will fall into place 
and if you don't you failed 
the pressure starts really young and it does your whole life but it's perhaps most pronounced when you're graduating from school right avances wow the world at your feet what are you going to do now 
it's so intimidating it's like picking a major for life 
I have heard of time picking a major for four years and I changed that once if not twice 
I mean it was like 
it's intimidating right 
in this compelling I mean this really in a forceful cultural imperative to choose your passion 
stressful to me but it's not just me if ever I talked to agrees with me 
the woman who sold me this dress I told her what I need to dress for my was talking about and she said oh my gosh I I really need to hear this talk because I just graduated from school my friends and I we don't know what we're passionate about we don't know what we're supposed to do 
I'm leery of passion for a few reasons but one of them is that passion is not a plan 
it's a feeling 
and feelings change 
they do you can be passionate about a person one day at a job and then not passion at the next 
we know this and yet we continue to use passion as the yardstick to judge everything by instead of seeing passion for what it really is 
the fire that ignites when you start rubbing sticks together 
anyway I was such a mess when I was in my twenties such a mass I was anxious and depressed and I had no life to speak of I was temping to keep my options open 
and I was sitting around at night my underwear watching Seinfeld reruns 
actually I still do that that's not the worst thing in the world today 
fine but I called my mother every night crying and I was turning away perfectly good full time jobs why because I was afraid 
I was sure that I would pick the wrong one and get on the wrong train headed to the wrong future 
my mother begged me to sit please take a job any job you're not going to be stuck your stock now 
you don't treat your life first and then live it you created by living it not agonizing about 
she's right she's always right 
and so I took a full time job as is an assistant at a management consulting firm where I knew nothing about nothing okay 
zero 
except I knew I had a reason I get up in the morning get showered leave the house and people who were waiting for me when I got there and I got a paycheck every two weeks and that is as good a reason to take a job as Annie 
did I know that if I want to be an office administrator for the rest my life I had no idea 
truly but this idea that everything you're supposed to do should fit into this passion vertical is unrealistic and Australia elitist 
you show me someone who washes windows for a living and I will bet you a million dollars is not because he has a passion for clean glass 
well my favorite columns is a piece by Dilbert creator Scott Adams he wrote a piece in the wallstreet journal fears ago about how he failed his way to success and one of his jobs was as a commercial loan officer 
and he was taught specifically do not loan money to someone following their passion 
no loaded to someone who wants to start a business the more boring the better 
Adams says that in his life success fueled passion more than passion field success 
when I got my first job as a magazine editor in publishing I was thrilled but I had to take a pretty big pay cut 
because at the time I'd been a catalogue copy writer and a wig company 
laughs if you well clearly you are and many many people did but weeks paid 
and so I have to figure out a way to make some money so friend of mine invited me to a jury party and I said what is a jolly parties is that I would like Tupperware but with bracelets I said okay goddess 
got it I went and I had the best time I was there hanging out trying on tour in the sales persons have a great time and I was like 
it's a job 
do that 
I mean really she seems to be having a great time now I had no background in sales in the second girl scouts I was terrible and I had no passion for jury I mean honestly my earrings cost twenty dollars combined all of that 
and I was like I think I can sling silver jewelry to suburban moms are drinking Dockery's yes I could do that and so I did I sign up arguments about a designs rap and I get listening I was not setting the world on fire right away really I was so unlike awkward and afraid of selling and they get better 
like a better start making some money start getting really passionate about it not just because of the money but because what I realized as people wanted to stuff they were happy to pay for it 
sold so much jewelry that year I won a free trip to Saint Thomas 
true 
I've actually let my jewelry business go because my career path shifted but I was so glad that I did that 
because it planted an entrepreneurial seat I didn't know was there and that bears fruit to this day 
now as you know an entire cottage industry has sprung up around helping people find their passions write books coaching webinars whatever and their hearts in the right place it's great I'm all about self discovery 
okay but when you have someone or your ass like what's your passion it's it's triggering it's like it suddenly go my god I have to come up with a good answer for this 
one of my friends is in her mid forties and she's looking at like what's her life going to be now and she's like 
I don't know what I'm passionate about it she's legitimately concerned about that she's ready to hire a team of people 
how are we worrying about this you know why because you think something's wrong with her 
I thought something was wrong with me when I was in the seventh grade and everyone was really is just like the rock bands in their actors Anne would carve the names of those bands in the tables at the library 
and I never heard anything because I couldn't think of anything to color 
I mean I like Bon Jovi as much as the next girl but not enough to deface school property you know 
that's probably why I don't have any other I don't have any tattoos either I'm assuming that's hot 
I thought it was really boring I thought something was wrong with me 
but that's the fear isn't it 
that when someone asks you at a party on a date at a job interview witty passionate about 
that you're not going to have this wow compelling answer and that that means you're not interesting or ambitious 
or that you don't have a singular obsession or scary talent that you're hiding and that your life isn't is worth living and that's not true 
passion is not a job a sport or hobby 
it is the full force of your attention and energy that you give to whatever is right in front of you in if you're so busy looking for this passion 
you could miss opportunities that change your life 
you can also miss out on great love 
because that's what happens when you have tunnel vision 
trying to find the one 
we all think we know the kind of person we are and the kind of person we could love 
sometimes were wrong 
blissfully wrong 
and sometimes you know what you're gonna do next right I mean I don't know what not knowing what I'm gonna be doing five years from now or would all be into and that's okay it's okay earth to know you know why because the most fulfilling relationships the most filling careers are those that still have the power to surprise you 
and as for the things you know you want to do you want to write a book you want to start a business 
you want to change careers great but ever sit around waiting for passionate show up and take you there you're gonna be waiting a long time 
so don't wait 
instead 
spend your time and attention solving your favorite problems 
look for problems that need solving 
be useful generous people will thank you and hug you and pay you for it and that's where passion is where your energy and effort meet someone else's need 
that's when you realize 
passion lives 
in realizing what you have to contribute what do you think when you ask people what their passion about they say helping other people 
so don't wait 
listen to my mother 
just start doing 
because 
to live a life full of meaning and value you don't follow your passion 
your passion follows you 
thank you
