ok i'm here today i'm going to i want to talk about space exploration challenges
that are still in front of us as we go forward
we've solved a lot of them in the past but there's a couple of key ones that we
still haven't solved and i would say we need your help to do that
so that's what i'm here today to talk about as I was growing up as i was a
young boy
many years ago I saw a number of major accomplishments that NASA sheet over the
years and the biggest one for me was nineteen sixty-two was when John Glenn
orbited orbited the earth
that was huge for me I was about 10 years old and that really changed my
life and i ended up obviously Here I am today I'm working it
john h plan research center so that was a huge thing for me and and then after
that point in time we after we orbited the earth then we went to the moon and
69 and that was a huge event how do we get a person of the move and get them
back and all that
how do we just go about doing that so that was a huge and I think NASA had
like I don't know how many thousands of people work but thousands working on
their job and we accomplish that and then in the seventies we put started to
put together the space shuttle and because we wanted to be able to shuttle
things the lower Thorpe low Earth orbit and we wanted to do it on a regular
basis two three four five times a year and we try to keep that rate up and and
so we did that when he has everybody knows we just decommissioned shuttle now
the station and then in the nineties are in the nineties with the shuttle we
built the space station which sits up there now and produces about a hundred
hundred kilowatts of power and there
three to four astronauts on the station at all times
so those are huge things that we did and what we need to do
I mean the goal always was to push people out into deep space and what I
want to talk about today is there's a couple of challenges that we have that
are are hitting us that we were having difficulty moving forward and getting
those challenges solved and moving us forward
I wanted to start out with this picture this is a picture of Saturn taken by the
Cassini spacecraft
ok and the Cassini spacecraft is being darkened by Saturn
so it's your we just imagine you're on you're on the other side of Saturn and
you're looking at it you're looking at the Rings and on the other side of
Saturn is the Sun ok
and so that spacecraft was launched in 1997 it is still out there today still
taking this
these kinds of images and producing that kind of data and I don't know if you can
see it but there's a little . out to the upper left hand corner there in the ring
they're a little colored spot there that's the earth
okay in that image so it's amazing you know we launched in 1997
I think it took a seven or eight years to get to Saturn and those are the kind
of images were able to bring back with the technology we've got so that's the
kind of that's what we can be seeing out there if we were out there today
I mean that's the main point what are the challenges
this is a little technical but i thought it's it's very important
one of the things this this this curve shows is how little solar power there is
out beyond Jupiter ok when you get the sad when you go beyond Jupiter where you
basically have zero solar power
so this is one of the problems that we have in going out past Mars you can see
on Mars we've sent Rovers to Mars and their solar powered and we've managed to
run around Mars and things like that
and now we know we have another over there that's nuclear-powered but when
you start getting out and start exploring space
you just can't accomplish what you want to do with the current the current
technology we have today
so we've got a we've gotta use the technologies of God we got to keep
pushing out one of the ways we did
Cassini this Cassini spacecraft is we do it with radioisotopes and we have
radioisotopes that the Q&A
there's a radioactive decay process and when they decay
they give off a lot of heat and that that little glowing red pellet there on
the right there is a natural radioactive decay of an isotope because we
concentrate the isotope and then we put it on a photo of thermoelectric device
so we put it on a couple and then we generate we just basically generate
attempt to get a temperature difference between deep space and that hot pellet
and we generally generate a DC current from man and the rover in the middle of
that picture there is the Curiosity rover and I don't know if you probably
can't see it but on the back of that Rover is a is one of our are
radioisotope power systems
ok so it's sitting there producing power produces about a hundred 10 watts of
power
that's what how the rover is enabled to survive and it doesn't just provide
power it awful provides heat because there's not enough heat out there as
well
so one of the ways we get at are one of the technologies that we use is
radioisotope power system because this Rover is a lot more efficient a lot more
effective and it can go day and night and all that
where the solar powered Rovers couldn't do it so that that's one of the
technologies that we were pushing out
this chart shows some of the missions we've run
I mentioned Cassini we have a Mars 2020 mission coming up in 20 viously 2020 the
Curiosity rover and then some people i'm sure people have heard about the Voyager
1 and voyager 2 spacecraft those are also radioisotope power system missions
and they're still out there they're just starting to go through the heliosphere
and sending back data to us so this is just gives you an idea of the kinds of
missions were able to do and how many we've done over the years we've just
done so many end up
we used radioisotopes on Apollo as well
they carried him out on Apollo and those missions are reflected here and we use
them for orbit fly by roving and landing so we use them in all kinds of different
we provide all kinds of different capabilities this is a picture of the
rover again of the Curiosity rover
like I said it's a it's about a hundred 10 watts of power and a constant power
but look at the efficiency for thermal electrics it's only about six percent
efficient so that's just I mean the amount of kilowatts per kilogram is just
very low it's about two kilowatts per kilogram for the <time> six </time> for
this Rover
so that's the current state of the art that we have here
what I've been working on recently are some new concepts as Meredith said we've
got a new device which is a Stirling engine it's a dynamic device and we can
generate basically four times the power with the same amount of radioactive heat
radioactive decay
so it's much safer much everything's better that's much more efficient system
and then finally you know your house your house that you live in you've got
about 15 kilowatts in your house that's what you need in your house to live and
you can see I'm building systems i'm sending systems out the deep space that
are only a hundred or a hundred twenty watts or so I can't live on hard 20
watts
so I need to have larger systems so the only system if if we're going to go out
beyond
Jupiter and to explore the solar system
we've got to come up with with higher power systems and the only system we've
been able to come up with that can provide that kind of power density is a
reactor systems basically nuclear reactor systems but up to this point I'm
there's a lot of political and all kinds of other challenges associated and
safety challenges associated with flying a reactor so we haven't actually
demonstrated that cap capability at all so right now we're limited to doing
things between here and the moon and here in Mars and fairly low power
you know a hundred couple hundred watts that kind of thing those kinds of
missions so so that's that's one of the challenges and that's why we're working
on these dynamic systems the other the other big challenge we have is just
radiation in space there's a field of radiation out there
high energy I on electrons all kinds of charged particles and they're just
everywhere and this is showing the magnetics protection that the earth
provides to these particles so we're sitting here on earth and we have this
protection system around us and the particles can't get to us because and
and then what were effectively shielded from that
so the problem is when we go out into deep space these particles are
everywhere and there's a tremendous number of them and and we have the
effect our electronics and they affect us
so the one of the biggest problems we have is what's the effect on us as we
travel deep space and how do we protect ourselves
so I wanted to put this in when the Mars Science Laboratory travel to Mars last
year and landed last year that the the last couple of last couple of bars on
this chart are our radiation dose
ok they measured radiant radiation dose on the way to Mars and it took them
about six months and then there's a another the red bar on there is the 500
days on mars
so if you take the the bars that show
if you takes you six months to get the Mars and you spend 500 days on mars and
then you spend a hundred and hundred eighty more days coming back if you add
up just those last two bars on that curve
I know that on that and that curve there you end up with a dose that is deadly to
you know that's not that's not healthy for humans i would say deadly but they
had not good news because you can sit
you can see the comparisons here for the other things or the space station things
like that so we need to solve that problem we need to solve
how we protect ourselves if we're going to do these missions to Mars and other
places in deep space and we do not have the answer for this
this is one of the things we just don't have the answer and we also haven't
demonstrated the power capability that we need out there to live and survive in
deep space they have the habitation because like I said you need 15 to 30
kilowatts
that's why the station has a hundred kilowatts on it because you use about 25
all the time
and if you're sitting on the station you you want to have that backup
I mean you don't you want another 25 and another 25 and another 25 because you
know that you just saw they had the pump problem on station and they lost some
some of their cooling on half of the station
so you you want to have that other half of the station still running and you
know and then your cooling it so that you have that redundancy so you need
that kind of you need the same kind of thing that we have on the station out in
deep space
so what I wanted to leave you with is we need to figure out this how we're going
to accomplish these deep-space missions as a as a nation as NASA and as a nation
and you folks out there it's not going to be in my generation
it's not going to happen from what i see so
the way to solve the radiation problem is we need shorter exposure time
really and we need and we need shielding
ok now there are ways to get shorter exposure time which is you travel faster
but how do you travel faster and we're having you know if there's a you can use
chemical but then how do you replenish when you get out there and so forth so
it's very difficult to do so new that there's nuclear thermal and then there's
ion engines and things like that but it turns out from what we've looked at the
ion engines just don't try to provide the kind of impulse we need to get out
there in a hurry because we'd like to shorten the time to come to mars - 30
days or so like six times faster and we don't know how we don't have the systems
in place to do that today
so we the main thing we need to do is we need to demonstrate something that gives
us that capability as we move forward here
that's that that's the dream that we just keep moving forward and keep
pushing out
so how do we do that and right now there
there's nothing on the books that says here this is what we're going to do this
is how we're going to get there so the other thing the radiation challenge is
such a big challenge for us we don't know what to do with it
we have a website that's been set up and it's the NASA exploration design
challenge for radiation and they're asking all of you at this website asking
all of you to participate and it it goes to K through 12 k through 12
college students whoever's out there NASA and and we're all looking for ideas
for how we solve that problem for deep space exploration
how do we protect ourselves how do we shield ourselves what are the mechanisms
where the new ideas that could come our way where we could do that
so we need that data we need that information from whoever's got it
and you have any new ideas people have and then we're going to go ahead and
well
it won't be me but the we'll go ahead and implement those ideas in the future
so that's what i want to leave you with is we have major challenges to keep our
dream alive of exploring deep space and radiation and power we need to come up
with some demonstrations and do those demonstrations in the next couple of
decades so that we can keep pursuing our dreams on in the deep space that's all
ok
