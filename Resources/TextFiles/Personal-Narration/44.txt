thank you
thank you
beyond boundaries with a theme huh
beyond now when I think of boundaries I think of rules regulations and
restrictions and I think of the parents and the teachers and the supervisors who
hold us accountable
with regard to those boundaries now that's not a bad thing
now I know if you're like me i need supervisors I need someone holding me
accountable to do the right thing but beyond boundaries is something different
I think of those leaders those teachers those supervisors those parents who
inspire us to go beyond the call of duty to to do more than we have to
to do it not because they tell us but because we want to i would like to share
with you what the research says about how to make that happen and not just for
other people but for yourself
here's the deal how can we inspire people in ourselves to be self-motivated
there's another word it's called empowerment you've heard that word right
and the management definition of empowerment is get her done
just get her done with fewer resources and less time I am power you make it
happen
I'm talking about feeling empowered
that's different feeling empowered is when yourself motivated now if you want
to know if you feel empowered or if your child your student your worker feels
empowered asked them three questions and if they say yes say yes to these three
questions they will feel empowered and by the way this is not based on common
sense is based on research but you've all been near so will feel like common
sense question number one
can you do it albert bandura calls itself efficacy
do you believe you can do it do you have the time the knowledge and the training
to do what we're asking you to do if you answer yes
good
second question will it work
do you believe that we're asking you to do the process
we're at will work albert bandura calls that response efficacy believing that
the behavior will lead the ultimate outcome by the way that takes education
right
we have to show them the data we might show them some theory like we show them
teach them
why this might work I just use the word education
earlier I used the word training is there a difference in elementary school
if we call it education middle school education high school education College
higher education then you go to industry what do you call it training you have
your training department
there must be a difference well you know the difference
do you want your kids to have sex education or sex training
and your kids my answer the question differently because you know that
training means you do the behavior and you get feedback as a powerful powerful
have you ever heard this word online training is an oxymoron it
I mean training is watch the behavior get online training
it's like plastic silverware jumbo shrimp legal brief country music make it
done work ok so if you answer yes to it will work
third question is it worth it
so we've had a training question we've had an educational question
this is the motivational question do you believe the consequences
this is about consequences BF Skinner taught us this selection by consequences
Dale Carnegie quoted BF Skinner and said from the day you were born
everything you did was because you wanted something for doing consequences
is it worth it so you have to convince people that it's worth it now by the way
if you answer yes to those three questions you feel competent
am i right you feel competent at doing worthwhile work
you've all been there when you feel confident at doing worthwhile work you
more likely to be self-motivated
you've been there no one has to be looking over you you feel cut now here's
the challenge leaders teachers
how do you inspire people to feel confident we can give them feedback to
give them recognition you show them they are competent
okay I got one more letter C word choice
your common sense will tell you when you believe you have a sense of autonomy a
sense of choice in what you're doing you feel more self motivated BF Skinner
taught us that too in his book Beyond freedom and dignity will be back in
nineteen seventy one reading that book changed my life because I realized that
I am controlled by consequences
but sometimes I don't feel controlled when i'm working for a pleasant
consequence
it feels good it feels like I'm working to get something when I'm working to
avoid an aversive consequence
I feel controlled that's called negative reinforcement
so here's a challenge leaders how do we get people to become success seekers
rather than failure avoiders first they have introductory psychology class I
Keats two classes of 600 students may be some have been in that class and
remember the first day I say how many are here to avoid failure at eighty
percent raise your hand and I say well thanks for coming
I know you're motivated but you're not happy campers
you probably told your friends I got to go to class
it's a requirement not i get to go to class
it's an opportunity you probably woke up to an alarm clock
not an opportunity clock
and it's all in how you see it really it's all in how you see it
it's your paradigm it's how you communicate to others and how you
communicate to yourself
so Ellen Langer said in her book
mindfulness she said and psychologists know when you perceive choice you
perceive motivation
you're more motivated so the deal is for yourself sit back and reflect be mindful
of the choices you have
and talk about being a success Seger rather than a failure avoider
it's all how you talk how you communicate to yourself and to others
I got a fourth C word community powerful word psychologist know that social
support is critical
people who perceive a sense of relatedness a sense of connection with
other people
they feel motivated and they're happier
I want to sign up recite a poem is called a cookie thief by Valerie cocks
and as I recite this poem
there's only two characters a man and a lady put yourself in the situation
be mindful think about the situation and what you would do
okay here we go a woman was waiting in an airport one night with several hours
before her flight
she hunted for a book in the airport shop bought a bag of cookies and found a
place to drop
she was engrossed in a book and happened to see that the man beside her as bold
as could be
look at cooking or two from the bag between but she tried to ignore to avoid
a scene
she read much cookies and watch the clock as a gutsy cookie thief to
Minister stock
she was getting more irritated as the minutes tick by
they get up I wasn't so nice I black and his eye with each cookie she took he
took one too
well know anyone was like she wanted what to do with a smile on his face and
a nervous laugh
he took the last cookie
and he broke it in half he offered her half as he ate the other she snapped him
thought old brother
this guy has some nerve and he's also rude
it didn't show any gratitude she never know what you've been so called and she
sighed with relief when her flight was called to gather her belongings and
headed for the gate refusing to look back at the thieving in great
she boarded the plane and second her seat and she soccer book which is almost
complete
as she reached her baggage she gasp with surprise there was her bag of cookies in
front of her eyes have minor here
she moaned in despair and the others were his
he tried to share too late to apologize
she realized with grief that she was the route 1 the ingrate
the thief so where were you when I when I was from where were you
whose side were you on were you thinking independent or interdependent
I don't blame you think independent you know that's how we raise nice guys
finish last
squeaky wheel gets the grease gotta blow your own horn
you know independent we come in this in this life of ours dependent to others
and we can't wait to become teenagers you know we're too old to do what kids
do too young to do what adults do so that will do what nobody else would do
to assert your independence and some of us get stuck
we're stuck he'll do it myself I don't need you
not good we need each other
we have to have each other's back we need a sense of community
this independence culture that we got we gotta move to inter dependent
ok for see words that can fuel self-motivation and I think can fuel
actively caring for people
let me tell you a story to put it all together it happened over 60 years ago
I remember it like yesterday
my parents ask me hey Scott how did you like get drum lessons
how'd you like to play the drums oh man would I ever
I'm thinking of Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa most you guys don't know those
names but they were the drummer's know in those days of drum was in front of
the band they had white pearl drum sets and I saw myself that was my vision I
had a vision consequences
that was my vision and I said yeah I want to take drum lessons so the teacher
would bring his drum set next to mine I didn't have a nice drum like this my
parents bought me a beatable drum at an auction and they said to me if you get
better if your teacher tells us you get all their holding me accountable teacher
says you're getting better
we'll get you a better snare drum and then a base German in some symbols and
that was my vision and that kept me going
consequences so the teacher would come in and he would show me stuff you know
this is how left hand this is help buddy rich plays with his left hand and his
right hand and they would just do things like a flam
you hear that you're back ok
and this is visiting rim shot he would show me so I was just 10 years old
remember when you showed me stuff I felt
wow he showed me this little simple drum beat watch me Scott watch this
I practiced it and I didn't
I'm feeling competent to show me a paradiddle will listen and you say you
go home when you practice next week I want to see your power Dylan I said
watch this
hey watch this he said that's a double paradiddle I wouldn't we didn't get
there yet i'm reading ahead
because I'm self-motivated I feel competent
I'm walking through muhlenberg high school allentown pennsylvania and I see
the music teacher and he says I heard you're learning to play the drums that's
it yeah and I'm getting good
he said you can march in the band you can be the snare drummer
whoa that felt kind of another vision
then the teacher comes into my this is these are private lessons by the way -
dollars - dollars that was a long time ago he said it's just it's scott ready
to do a drumroll
I said course I I'm ready for a drum boys as watch scott here you go watch
this
would you do that again
Scott this is easy
watch me now you practice that and next week
I want to see a drumroll he comes back next week is it how's your drop them
I can do a paradiddle that's regression
I want to see a drumroll week after week now we're talking about distress
now we're talking about apathy
now we're talking about learned helplessness that's what psychologists
call it
I remember walking through that elementary school and seeing a music
teacher and he said
so Scott how you doing how the drums that's so good
I can't do a drumroll you don't like it like adults always say never say can't
you give me anything you want to be Scott
no I can't do a drumroll I've tried and I tried and I I've kind of given up and
he said scott when you ever get overwhelmed
break it down break it down can you do a paradiddle yeah
ok what's the second b2b yeah well that's a drumroll Keller is to be so you
go home when you practice and you say dad and mom remember i was just can't
you go to that teacher came back the next week
okay Scott I guess you can't do a drum all I said watch this
- whoa how'd you learn to do that and i showed my teacher
I taught my teacher 10 years old he said I'd forgotten that it's I got into the
habit of just doing this
forgot that is trippin you taught me how to teach the drum roll Scott there's a
lesson there we can always learn from each other
we need to have the humility to accept feedback and the courage to speak up and
we need to help each other feel self motivated
how given the perception of competence teach him about consequences drive us
you know let him perceive choice and let him know its community
we're all in this together and we need each other
thank you
yeah
yeah
