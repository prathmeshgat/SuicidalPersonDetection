so it's two weeks from prom and you don't have a date
what are you going to do or maybe you have a job interview for that dream job
and you really want to win the employer / but how do you make sure they like you
well there's actually a very simple solution and it's called not who you
want to be not who you want to be turns you almost instantly into someone else
wants you to be for those last-minute date Fiasco's important job interviews
awkward meet the families
you name it now somebody say you should always be who you are but take it from
me this product can come in handy in a multitude of situations
all you have to do to ace that interview have the family fall in love with you or
get that date is simply program the name of the person you're trying to impress
into the Machine and how long you'll be with them and out pops a pill and within
20 minutes you'll be their favorite person in the world
this pill carefully works to install a mental filter for those boys who seem to
lack one bring the quiet girl out of her shell or quiet the incessant talker
nothing else can make you so instantly pleasing to those people you have to
impress for a short period of time . he want to be is recommended by four out of
ten marriage counselors and nine out of ten mother-in-law's not who you want to
be is brought to you by who would want to be you
the family company that's brought you such products as thanks
hair dye and concealer who would want to be you is turning the expertise they
possess and changing your physical exterior into a fantastic product that
can change your personality just like Spanx and concealer don't actually get
rid of that extra chub you got or thats it you just can't stop thinking about
not who you want to be doesn't actually change who you are
however unlike our other products that turn your inner beauty outwards not how
you want to be turns your outer beauty in works
after years of laboratory research careful test and extensive studies you
can be sure that not who you want to be subtly changes your personality but
never fails to return you back to normal
so you can be who you want
be after you've had your fill of being not who you want to be
now do you want to be is not recommended for people with multiple personality
disorders not who you want to be when you feel like you're just not good
enough
thank you
