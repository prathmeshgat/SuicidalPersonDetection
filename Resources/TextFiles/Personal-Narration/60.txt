hi my name is Caroline McGee and I've always been told to never give up
what's the one thing that you wanted to be when you grew up
princess an astronaut superhero
well I know from my childhood my parents have always told me go after my dream
and never under any circumstances give up you fall down seven times just and
update is what they were always told me but I never quite understood what never
giving up truly me and I never realized how much hard work and effort you have
to put into it
that is until recently well when I was about five years old we have the local
recreation department had cheerleading sign ups and that was it i mean what i
wanted to be a cheerleader so I signed up you know when you sign up for a
recreation department kinda do you don't have to be the best you don't even have
to try your best
you're automatically on the team and this mount set of not having to try you
automatically made it
follow me up the middle school where you can mention the disappointment I feel
when each year I didn't make the squad
well then high school tryouts claimed this was the real deal
the varsity team i had to make it so I ran home and told my parents and they
looked at me like you know what Carol I'm never really tried
so this time you have to give it 100 percent and you can never ever give up
these words finally site and it hit me you know i really have to try this time
if i want to make the squad so after tryouts
you know I've given it my all and I said they're waiting for my name to be called
knows that you know what this time i will be as disappointed because I know I
really give it my all and I've tried and tried this time breaking through my
thoughts I heard and with the high score Caroline McGee almost bring out the door
to go to
mom I couldn't believe it well I couldn't believe it that given it my all
and I realized that you know what I made it this time because i took my parents
bass and I never gave up
