my name is Janelle chabria i was born in los angeles california by family decided
to move to Nashville Tennessee when i was leaving the first grade so about 13
years ago my family decided it was a better option than the school district
over there in Los Angeles and as well as my mom's family was already living here
so they thought it would be better for my brother and I to be surrounded by
more family because and Los Angeles it was just us four I have an older brother
he is two years older than me and he also comes to UT he is my best friend
we never really thought we were younger we've always been really close
my parents are from Costa Rica i speak fluent spanish and i hope to learn how
to speak fluent French and Italian because i really want to trouble in the
future i went to high school and downtown Nashville and it was called
Martin Luther King jr. a lot of people haven't heard of it because it is
downtown but it is very academic base so we have tons of homework we didn't
really have much time to do anything else but i graduated from there in 2014
and i decided to attend UT i want to be a pediatrician
I want a major and nutrition and I have a concentration in pre-med and hopefully
a minor in spanish i love to play piano and I love to sing
i watch netflix a lot which my mom always says it's very bad for me but
it's very entertaining and I'm very eager for this class will teach me
because being a pediatrician i'll have to interact with a lot of families and a
lot of children so I know I definitely need the skills
