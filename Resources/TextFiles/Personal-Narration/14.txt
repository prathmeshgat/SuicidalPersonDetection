thank you very much thank you so much 
well 
I am I'm so grateful 
to be 
IBM 
warden to be 
such 
extraordinary company 
I first of all one I think 
all of you were involved 
making this possible but 
the main thing that I want to do here is to 
Salem inspired by the young people who are represent 
because I think that's the purpose 
%HESITATION ultimately of this foundation and I want to tell just a brief story because arch bishop tutu was here out one of my heroes 
and let you know where I was when I was about your age 
I'm really dating myself now 
although I'm also dating the arch bishop because 
%HESITATION back in nineteen seventy nine 
I was a freshman in college 
at Occidental College in California 
and I have had a somewhat rocky 
%HESITATION 
Houston and 
teenage years my father wasn't at home %HESITATION I 
%HESITATION was growing up partly with my grandparents in high school I got in trouble occasionally was 
what my mother called a good time Charlie 
%HESITATION meaning I wasn't really serious in terms of my studies in terms of my work 
had some awareness of the world around me had some sense of injustice 
on fairness but it wasn't a finely honed it was well developed 
and I remember in nineteen seventy nine arriving as a freshman and doing what freshmen do %HESITATION 
you know trying to figure out what courses 
our and trying to get a change of study habits and trying to identify about food Macavity area what it is 
%HESITATION 
and 
we were visited on campus by 
couple of gentleman from South Africa 
who were representatives the ANC 
in nineteen seventy nine nineteen eighty 
and 
they spoke about their efforts to overcome apartheid 
and 
for about 
an hour 
I myself in a group of students 
listen to to these young men who were not much older than we were 
describe the extraordinary struggles they were going through 
the sacrifices that were being made 
people who were in during jail and torture and beatings 
because they had a sense that 
somehow 
some way 
a justice would prevail 
and 
that that brief meeting I think in some ways changed my life because what it told me first of all was that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they're given opportune 
we sometimes think that our leaders have to be 
have fancy degrees are well educated or some public office somewhere 
%HESITATION 
these young men had not none of those things 
but what they possessed was 
a anger over injustice that they were able to channel in a constructive positive way 
and I thought to myself that 
they gave me some sense of the direction that my wife 
might go 
and so I became active in the anti apartheid movement on 
I campuses and I not sure we were particularly effective as I recall Occidental College continued to refuse to divest 
spike the various protests that we organize the students I transferred to Columbia and when there was similar resistance on Columbia's campus 
but over time I like to think that I was part of that mosaic 
that apply pressure and ultimately 
helped 
those in South Africa achieve the extraordinary liberation %HESITATION that I would witness 
almost ten years later 
%HESITATION night %HESITATION it as they are as a lawsuit and I remember the image of Nelson Mandela walking out of prison 
and understanding that 
a seminal moment in history had occurred 
and that Mandela's long March towards freedom was not his alone but was 
part of thousands of footsteps 
of millions of footsteps of people all around the world 
and I trace back me getting involved in politics to that moment 
because I as a consequence of that organizing on a college campus I became a community organizer as a consequence of committee organized right 
after going back to law school became a civil rights attorney 
as a consequence of being a civil rights attorney %HESITATION I entered the state legislature and I now 
stand before you as a United States senator and 
the candidate for president 
and so that the primary message I guess I have it in receiving this award 
is that 
all of you 
%HESITATION represent 
enormous potential enormous possibility for change 
because we all know that injustice still existed just 
it exists here in the United States %HESITATION in every 
poor neighborhood and every inner city in every rural communities all across the country 
there is quiet desperation 
young people's lives are filled with 
sadness and desperation 
anarchy and chaos 
and obviously all around the world %HESITATION we see 
those same 
symptoms of hopelessness 
%HESITATION made manifest 
in places like Darfur 
places 
%HESITATION like the Middle East 
in places that 
too often forgotten about him not written about until they flare up in 
%HESITATION tragedy 
so I hope that all of you 
who are 
on the brink of doing extraordinary things 
I decide to channel that talent in that energy 
and that imagination 
%HESITATION to figuring out how do you 
%HESITATION 
move 
the process along for better history you know how do you put your shoulder against the wheel and 
move that boulder up the hill 
and I'm absolutely confident that if all of you take up that challenge 
of the world is waiting for you 
ready to be changed 
because I think we live in this moment in history right now where 
the 
hunger for change the hunger for something new the desire to break out of 
the ordinary the self interested the petty 
trivial 
is 
is everywhere 
and 
they're waiting for you 
and so I hope %HESITATION that as you see the recipients of this award 
%HESITATION you recognize that 
%HESITATION 
it's actually more of a 
tool to 
give you a little spark 
and drive you %HESITATION in the wonderful directions that I hope your life's take out in the years to come 
so thank you very much
