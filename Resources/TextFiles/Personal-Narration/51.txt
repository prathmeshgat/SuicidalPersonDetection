I remember that I can do anything Irish I tried my life and what is hype about
track
tracks you are still a lot of your best unacceptable how do you maintain the
challenges to your address and I'll try to get better is essential that israeli
last at least an hour to two hours and we had to let her know my coach Ricky
harvested so great and learning to do to be hard-working I was hard to remember
to never give up as usually first writing reviews so I noticed I had a
responsibility to you I'm very best ever get up by Dave about the animals were my
best you can do they are dictate our overall but only to my teammates and
never did i do right now to talk about my chances are so it happens you know
where they're not made possible by support you're not used to having a good
time so bogged down my stress or you like the way the world is on my
shoulders
I remember just like try to take that me off my shoulders so successful in your
body down by stress to learn to go
experiences I had tried to help shape Who I am very hard working and that has
really she tells me that I cannot stress so whatever your passion is whether it's
raining or died and run whatever it is so much better
