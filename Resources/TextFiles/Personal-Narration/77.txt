ok
hi it's tony robbins happy new year then how's your new you're coming out so
really it's january fifteenth and i thought i'd send you out this little
video message because you know what that day means don't you
january fifteenth is the cutoff statistics show that ninety-five percent
of the people that actually made a new year's resolution have already broken it
by today and that's if you even made a resolution
now if you're the exception of that I'm thrilled for you and I support you and I
said keep rocking it
but if you've missed maybe I could drop you a quick little message or to hear
that can help you not only recover but get way beyond just making some new
year's resolution and make some real lasting change in your life
I mean think about it most people don't even make a resolution anymore why
because they made him from years and years and years and they know they're
not going to follow through so after a while who wants to disappoint yourself
who wants to be upset with yourself
why even bother to set a new standard for this year you know it's gonna be the
same as last year
if you're the kind of person watching this right now and you've actually
opened that email and you haven't shut me off already
then obviously that's not you so the question is you know what is it that
makes us even want to make a resolution interesting question why is it at the
beginning of the year we have this tradition but it goes beyond tradition
it's something inside of us that makes us want to make things better and i
think part of it is the calendar gives us this idea that we can have a fresh
start that we can start from fresh and have this great victory and its really
the calendar itself is quite arbitrary it's wonderful to use it but if you
didn't use it effectively
let's use the calendar to serve you today let's just see what does it really
take to make this thing happen because there's no denying that inside of you
the only thing that's going to make you happy and the year ahead and the decades
ahead
it's going to be having you have an experience where on a regular basis you
feel like your life is making progress
there's one thing I teach and i want to remind you of its really simple things
getting things not going to make you happy
that's good news in a tough economy it's a good reminder you know doesn't matter
what you get doesn't matter whether it be money or opportunity
all those things might excite you for the moment you know even a relationship
is magnificent maybe might be exciting for a while but if you don't keep
growing that relationship is going to stay exciting
so the secret to real happiness is progress progress equals happiness and
if we can make progress on a regular basis we feel alive and that's why the
beginning of the year we get this thing like okay I can have this fresh start
I could really do with my soul desires i could expand I could grow
I could improve i could change or maybe better than change I could progress see
think about that progress is an aliveness to it doesn't it
you have to work at changing people say all the time now and i'm working on
changing
don't worry about it you have to work on changing changes automatic your body is
going to change what you wanted or not as the years go by no matter how hard
you work there's going to be some changes going on there
the economy is going to change no matter what you want to do
the weather is going to change relationships are going to change
everything in life is always changing we have to work on change change is
automatic but progress is not so if you want to make real progress then you
really gotta look at your life in a different way
you got to say I going to take control of this process and not just hope it's
going to work out like people do make a resolution is really is not what they're
really doing at the beginning of the year they're saying well here's my
resolutions for the year and they really basically tell you their wishes
it's their wish list that's what they hope it all comes together and then they
call it a resolution but they don't know what a resolution is when you resolve
something to have a resolution is to resolve it when you resolve this is how
it's gonna be that's when you cut off any possibility except the thing you've
committed to its like the old adage if you want to take the island
you burn the boats because when you bring those boats there's no going back
you're gonna find a way to make things work and most people there stating what
they hope will come together and if it doesn't happen then they're disappointed
but they're not too disappointed because they're not to vested
what does it take to successfully create a lasting change in your life to not
only have a new year's resolution you follow through on but really have a
lasting change well the first ever lasting change is very much like making
a new year's resolution
fundamentally it's the same the first step is you got to have a vision
a vision for what it is you really truly want not what you think you want to what
you should have I mean what most people new year's resolutions i'm going to stop
eating sugar
you know I'm gonna stop smoking i'm going to lose 10 pounds problem with
that is it's not very inspiring for most people you know if not telling you what
you're gonna get
it's only what you're not going to do and it's kind of hard to have you move
forward with that vision is about what you're here to create a vision that
really works is one that excites you
if you say well mine no my resolution my goal my outcome for this month this week
this year is to lose X number of pounds
that's okay but it's not very compelling it has to be a compelling vision has
gotta have something has the power to pull you not something you have to push
yourself to do with the two different kinds of motivation push requires
willpower and willpower never last
what will last is pull having something so exciting so attractive so something
you desire so much that you have a hard time going to sleep at night you get so
up early in the morning to a rocket and take it to the next level
that's what you're looking to create it wasn't easy to get but one of the
reasons we do seminars and events and saying you know why do that why isn't my
not just read a book or something is because when you get an environment
where you were people that are being put in a peak state like when you're going
to a sporting event if you watch sporting event at home it might have a
certain level of excitement but when you're in a stadium with 50,000 people
suddenly it has a whole different level of intensity when we feel that in the
bottom line of our follow-through comes down to our emotional intensity in a
different state of mind you're going to come up with a much better and more
exciting vision that if you're sitting on the couch going okay what am I new
resolutions for this year and you're doing it the morning after the new year
started your little inebriated and football games on the background
probably not going to have the power of focus they're probably not going to
power the energy to create something that's going to pull you for this year
and you got to do that so it's got to be a vision that's compelling something
that you know it's going to be a gift to make sure that happens and also along
with that compelling vision
you gotta have strong enough reasons that you're going to follow through when
the going gets tough
that's one of the biggest things missing for most people they said this is what I
want to do
it's not very exciting it's not very compelling but most importantly they
don't have strong enough reason to push themselves through what's going to be
necessary to get that dream to get that goal when the inevitable challenges come
up when you're starving hungry and you're trying to go on a diet right when
you got no time you're stressed out and you haven't worked out still that's what
you're supposed to do when the economy gets tight and what you thought you're
going to do doesn't work and so you give up on the goal instead of finding
another way to get there
you don't let the fear take you over if you've got strong enough reasons those
reasons can be positive or those reasons can also be negative they could be if i
don't do this is going to cost me
and if i do this this is what about a game in my life reasons come first
answers come second if you get a compelling vision and you got strong
enough reasons that will push you through the tough times you're going to
do things other people don't do is that are collapsing
even if you get off target you won't go I blew it you will get right back on
target make the change
make things happen and I know you've done this in many areas your life just
think about it again and I'm gonna teach me something really new here today
i just want to remind you what your soul knows you got to change you got to be
proved and you got to go through a simple process fundamentally to make
that progress first step
vision is compelling second step make sure that they're strong enough reason
to follow through third step
you've got to review it and feel it every day I mean anything if you have
this happen in your life has there been anything in your life that you've ever
wanted so badly you were so desirous of you got such a hunger for it that you
couldn't stop thinking about it could be a career move could have been when
you're a kid a car
it could have been a relationship it could have been anything but you were
obsessed you wanted to make this happen you want to attract this to your life
you want to
you just wanted something and you don't even know how to get it but it was so
compelling to you kept thinking about it every day envisioning imagining it
feeling it and then stuff happened and suddenly you started attract people or
situations to your life and it just came together like you don't even have a
total plan it was just that it was so part of your focus with so much
intensity of emotion so often that it sensitize you to notice anything that
could get you there
there's a part of your brain called the reticular
activating system for sure we call the ra is that part of your brain determines
what you notice in the world
that's really important because we set a goal when you get really clear in a
vision they're strong enough reasons and you review it enough it becomes a part
of you that part of your brain says anything that relates to this
I need to notice so i did you ever buy a certain kind of car or maybe a certain
outfit and suddenly you see that car everywhere those outfits everywhere
you know the cars were always around why do you see it now because your Ras knows
this is important this is part of my world map
similarly when you really get clear and it's compelling and you're reviewing it
every day . strong reasons you're viewing it every day and you're feeling
it
the brain becomes incredibly acute at noticing anything to get you to move
forward and so that's the power of this so you know what people do with new
year's resolution they come up with something kind of want
it's not a compelling vision they don't really have strong enough reasons and
they never reviewed again until they notice that they broke what they said
they really want to have make happen because they didn't really resolve the
resolve got the vision is compelling review a daily and you feel it you
envision it and you experience it simple as it sounds
now ultimately what is this really about ultimately if you're gonna have lasting
change in anything
you're really talking about just raising your standards and i always tell people
if you want to know how to change your life and give it to you in three words
boring as it sounds
raise your standards what does that mean
corny as it sounds raise your standards so thank you for the breakthrough
thought Tony I'm glad I wasted my time watching this little email with you but
think about it lasting change is different than a goal
you don't always get your goals but you always get your standards
maybe I'll help you to think about it this way I try to explain standards to
people with a different set of words
think of it as everybody in life gets there must seeeeee they will get their
should write think about it most people of a list of ships no they don't have a
list of the shoulds things you should do
you should follow through on I I should lose some weight i should work out more
i should make more calls i should respond more rapidly to my email
whatever you know i should get into the office earlier i should be you know more
confident whatever your should list is people loved after should list make me
mad but it's kinda like new years resolutions
if it does it's really exciting but if it doesn't which is most of the time
it's a little disappointing but you kind of know it's not gonna happen but when
you decide something is a must for you and absolute must when you cut off any
possible you say I'm gonna find the way I'm going to make the way human beings
when they resolve things may I make a real resolution inside themselves which
is they raised the standard they make it a must
they find the way I think about in your own life
how did you had some area of your life where you raise your standards your life
has never been the same
maybe at one time your life you smoke cigarettes or you did something and you
did it for years and you kept trying to change it trying to change it and kept
telling yourself I should
and then one day something happened something just clicked you over
something took you over that kind of tipping point and inside yourself you
said no more
it was a very very different experience wasn't it something inside you shifted
and what was a should became a must
and you never going back is there an area like that in your life you can
think of
again Jeffrey smoke cigarettes that you ever eat a certain way drink a certain
form of alcohol and finally saying no more you just don't go back and notice
this
it doesn't really take any willpower anymore because somewhere when we make
this click we make something a must
we attach ourselves to it it becomes part of our identity
one thing I've learned in the last gosh 33 years are working people from now
over a hundred countries four million people is human beings
absolutely follow through on who they believe they are and you said said to me
well i'm really going to work hard to stop smoking
but you know I've been a smoker my whole life and I'm you know I'm a smoker
I know your days are numbered going to be back smoking cigarettes again because
we all act consistent with who we believe we are
I tell people the strongest force in the whole human personality is this
need to stay consistent with how we define ourselves if you define yourself
as somebody who is really conservative
you're not going to be crazy and act not unless you're really drunk or something
and then you could say that the alcohol but it's really just you find getting
permission to be yourself
the alcohol is your excuse if you're really crazy person
you act crazy outrageous playful you don't have conservative because that's
not who you are
very often people say well I can't do that I'm not that kind of person and i
always say to people really when did you define yourself
I mean really how many years ago did you come up with what you couldn't couldn't
do in your life
how many years ago most people if they really look at how they're living their
life today
it's based on a set of standards a set of beliefs that they made choices about
10 20 30 or more years ago
I'm very often we made decisions in our youth or very young about what to
believe about what we were capable of about who we are as a person and that
becomes the glass ceiling if you will that controls us
there's a recording metaphor but it's true i remember one time I was with my
family at the circus and there's a person there and they had this big giant
elephant and you look at this elephant and they take this little rope put
around that opens neck and they drive the stake into the ground and I mean you
look at this you know that elephant could rip down the entire tent with
almost no effort and yet the elephant doesn't struggle doesn't try why cause
the elephant's conditions and they take that health and condition the elephant
when it's a baby elephant that's how they train them with a little baby
elephant it doesn't have the power yet they put a big rope around it and they
drive this huge stake in the ground and elephant fights and fights and fights
and one day finding that open decides I'm not capable of pulling this out
and once that becomes the definition of an identity of anyone an elephant in
this case they don't even try anymore
it's just who I am that's how it is that's just the way it is in my life I'd
like to ask you to take a look at any place you've got a limitation ask
yourself
did I decide to accept that limitation and you don't even see it as a
limitation you might see the just that's who I am but so often our lives we've
adapted to be a certain way so that we don't fail or so that people like us a
respective but it's not necessarily who we are
joy comes when you're spontaneous it's really hard to be truly happy when
you're not being yourself and most of us have no clue we are and so a big part of
my work
you ever been to an event you know is to get people to do things spontaneously
without thinking because that's when the real you shows up that's when the energy
comes alive and when you do that when you start to connect your true nature
suddenly there's energy available for you to set a higher standard for what
you want in your life
that's what this is really all about and want to talk about standards i talked
about you know shirts versus mus think about your own life
I know there have been areas in your life where some point in time you just
shifted and you raise the standard your life changed because whatever people
have their identity attached to
they live we live who we believe we are
that's just how it works it's just kind of like I give an example look at your
physical body your physical body today is an absolute reflection of only one
thing
not your goals not your desires but your standards
the identity you have for yourself if your standard is you're an athlete
then there's a certain amount of strength a muscle tone and energy that's
available in your body on a regular basis because that's who you are and so
you do whatever is necessary to maintain that identity again the strongest force
and the human personality is this need to stay consistent with how we define
ourselves because if you don't know who you are you would know how to act
once you lock in an identity your brain finds a way to keep you there
if you say you know man i'm overweight I've always been overweight I'm big
boned
and that's the story you've got then you're going to always find a way to get
back there that's you're settling . that's your identity that's where things
lock in
if you see somebody who is in really great shape you asked him do you work
out you know the answer yes how often and they'll tell you three times four
times five times a week whatever it is
on our last people who here works out at least five days a week and I'm stand up
and you look around that room and you know if they work out five times a week
as you can see their body
you don't just get a result without some kind of action without some form of
ritual ritual meaning actions you do consistently now the you get those
people that are out there working out five days a week
do they have more time than you do or I have or anybody else course not
is that a wife less busy of course not it's just a must for them they must work
out that way and they made that turn their life changed so i'm not saying you
have to work out five days a week
I'm just saying whatever you really want once don't get met consistently
standards do whatever you identify this is who I am and so it's not so much
about changing your identity is there is expanding it
you know deciding that you know instead of your goal is to lose 10 pounds which
is not compelling what if your vision was to get back to my fighting weight
you know just this year this month this next 90 days I'm going to transform my
body i'm going to take on a new challenge I'm gonna find some technique
or strategy there's a million of them they can refrain myself I want to feel
younger stronger more vibrant than ever before
here's my reasons because i want the energy to really make my life work
because it's tough out there and I want to be stronger than I've ever been
before
only going from the mirror and I'm naked not you know what a laugh I look there
and take a good look and go yeah
I'm proud of whenever I see there
whatever it takes I'm gonna make you last smile someone's going to teach
yourself but someone's going to move you to another level if you identify
yourself in a new way and you own that every day and that becomes the stairs .
you live you'll find a way to make that standard real money is the same way i
think about it doesn't matter what's happening
quote unquote in the marketplace people that make money
find a way to make money no matter what don't think I mean most people standard
is to pay their bills
so that's what most people find a way to do even economic times get top most
people that's their absolute standard to find a way some people
standard is pay their bills most of the time and so most of the time they do
some people standard is not just to pay the bills but to take care of your
family and maybe even some of their friends and they find a way
in fact you might have some people may be in a family where they don't have
enough money to barely have money to pay their bills they work their guts out and
then somebody their mother their father somebody else their sister gets ill and
there's not enough money to take care of it nobody else has money and family--do
neither but they find a way to get that money to take care of her mother father
don't they and their belt
they never could do before why the situation made them raise their own
standard and not everybody does that somebody else in the family might have
money and still not take care of her mother
it all comes down to the inner game my friends changing your life is a change
in the inner game
the outside world you can't control but you have absolute control of this one if
you learn the dynamics of what shape shoe and identity is one of those simple
clear fundamental basics that if you start start to shift that everything
else will shift in your life as well
something by the way have to have more than enough money to do what they want
when they want where they want with whomever they want contribute the way
they want if that's there must be find a way
I know that sounds overly simplistic but it's true
somebody once said you can take all the money in the world out of the hands of
everybody out of all the wealthy people the world were really successful giving
other people wouldn't take too long those people have it back in your hands
now because they are manipulated because they have a standard one minute we don't
get me wrong but
we got a standard of what they're gonna find a way to make happen I'm just
simply saying to you take those three magic words and live and raise your
standard if you really want to do it and i'll tell you the most important secret
have you ever done this have you ever told yourself you raise your standard
okay I'm gonna go make this happen
I'm gonna go make this much money I'm gonna transform my kids i'm going to
create the ultimate relationship of my life i'm going to transform my body
whatever it is and then you don't have strong enough reasons and you don't lose
you use it you know
follow through it's because you didn't back up your standards with what makes
those standards real and that's rituals rituals
all the power is whenever we do our Robbins results coaching and Robin's
equals results that we get results with people
it's the same way if you listen to my ultimate edge program are back in the
old days personal power or if you went to one of my seminars you know what I do
is I take these huge challenges you got and we break them down into little
bite-sized steps little things you do each day that after you do then you get
so much momentum that it's easy to succeed you're not overwhelmed you have
these victory day after day after day on little things
if you'd want to ultimate edge i'm sure you learn about the hour of power or the
15 minutes to be able to be fulfilled or 30 minutes to thrive where you literally
just condition your body and emotion with a couple little rituals so it
doesn't matter what's going on in your world you feel that strength and it's
not fake its not sump pump up
it's coming from inside you and it works rituals define us
see all the results in your life are coming from your rituals they start with
a standard and they have rituals that following up like for example if you are
where you want to be physically you are very different rituals then if you're
not where you want to be physically you're overweight
you and I both know you got a different ritual then if you're physically fit
completely different
you get up in the morning with the first thing you do if you're fit your shoes
are there you roll over to the men how you feel you put on the issues relating
to start walking or whatever that ritual is if you're overweight you roll over
and you have a very different ritual
you might roll over several times to turn the alarm clock off you go in and
get your mocha smoker whatever you know special coffee you stop by at starbucks
over the case may be you have your nice sugar muffin
you know it's supposed to be really nice for you whatever you do it's a different
ritual
if you have a great passionate relationship you have very different
rituals and how you come home then if you have a lousy relationship become
home and the first thing you do is you're tweeting somebody or you're
emailing or flipping on the news or you don't even come home
what are the rituals whenever I study people that are successful
well I look for is what's the standard they hold himself - and the winner all
those little rituals that up because think about it
success and failure are not giant events
they don't just show up you don't just suddenly become successful suddenly have
this cataclysmic event that makes you fail and they look that way but failure
comes from all the little things
its failure to make the call its failure to check the books
its failure to say I'm sorry its failure to push yourself to do things physically
that you don't want to do it all those little failures day after day
come together into one day some cataclysmic event happens you blame that
event happened because you missed all the little stuff
do you agree with me and success by the way is not some overnight event it's all
these little things
success is having a vision success is making it compelling success is really
seeing and feeling and every day was strong enough reasons success he is
feeling the sense that i'm here to grow and i'm here to give something to the
world more than just myself
success is caring about the people success is calling and saying I love you
in the middle of the day for no damn reason for sending a note that will
change your relationship have a ritual of something funny playful or a surprise
you how many relationships are dead today because they have no surprise
rituals anymore
you need to have some rituals some cool things you do that nobody else does that
give you a better life than anybody else house all the little stuff that's where
success comes from in business it comes from delivering more than anybody could
imagine all those little things that are people go wow that's who I want to do
business with
it's true in any area of your life so if you look at somebody is really
successful you think wow I mean there are so amazing they're such a genius
you gotta dig underneath you got to remember something people over
did in public for what they practice for years in private
myself and my business people say how you get up and speaking of no notes and
you go for three days and nights in the room is like is wired that's incredible
find a rock concert
how do you do that how do you have that confidence hall and you know it's not
confidence its experience now but i did so much behind the scenes and I still do
to make things right
I mean how many people would know that since the time I was 17 years old before
I walk on stage still do to this day wouldn't need to do it but i still do it
I never walk out there without being in an absolute peak state of mind you know
their days my back is hurting my throat was hurting or I may have a challenger
my father passed away and I still got to deliver for these people because my
standard is give my all every time everyone has to be better talk to
anybody has been to events 4 5 10 years some of our trainers everything I don't
know he does that he's always finds a way to make it better that's not an ego
thing that's a standard and me have to find the way and my ritual though is I
prepare i think i got the new information I figure out how to put
something cross better what do people need I spend time with our customers
I see what's going on and before I get on stage each time and this ritual to
put myself in a state of mine and I did it
starting like 17 years old I started doing it I now command my subconscious
mind and i say this out loud several times this little phrase set of phrases
as an incantation to kind of condition my mind body and it's and now command my
subconscious mind to direct me in helping as many people as possible today
I give me the strength and the emotion and the humor in the brevity whatever it
takes to show this person to help this person change your life now and I
started out with a person when I work with people wanted one I would do that
for 45 minutes driving in my Volkswagen to go serve and coach somebody for the
first time
now I don't say that person i say these people and I can go out in room of
10,000 people and deliver 450 hours and I do it every time I come back on stage
it's a ritual a ritual to go into peaks pay pics they seem to show up and we
interrupt you
great ideas going there after you've got to pursue that
I talked to Michael Jordan i'll never forget that the peak of his career and
get to watch his final games song backstage and spend some time with him
and it was pretty exciting time is a great basketball player and I think that
ever lived and has ever lived and i asked my seen what sets you apart
Michael you know what is it and is it god-given talent ability skill what does
it mean to tell me you know so i can shoot you straight you know it's not you
know me try to act humble he goes have a lot of tell a lot of god-given talent to
school I worked really hard but he said really
it's my standards is it every day I demand more from myself and anybody else
could humanly expect
I'm not competing with somebody else I'm competing with what I'm capable of
hmm magic formula because most of us lower standards why because we spend
time with my friends who you become one of the biggest reasons i started going
to seminars when I was like 17 as I had nobody around me as a great role model I
can read about somebody but being around people being in that environment is very
different
find a way to go to work with someone who lived at standard life was very
different
you get around people low standards and compete with it
you don't need to compete with it's like okay I mean remember Jerry spring runoff
is still in the air but you know I've never used to get people on the show
that where would he find these people and why would people watch out everybody
watching me watching people in my life so pretty darn good compared that person
look at them you don't have to change your life all you have to do is find
somebody with a lower standard you feel good about yourself
but if you feel that good feeling it's an illusion the only thing that's going
to make you happy my friend in this year any other is to step up its to raise the
standard is to discover what you're capable of and feel that incredible
power pushing through whatever is holding you back and get to the other
side of more of your true self
that's what this games all about and look at the best in the world anything
Tiger Woods what's what's his vision to win golf tournaments know to be the best
that ever lived
that's his goal that decision but here's what's interesting he backed it up with
rituals if you just have a vision a unit of the rituals
stop lying to yourself his rituals are you start doing things nobody did before
you
they're lifting weights golfers lifting weights no way
he went out and he changed his swing when he was the best in the world
because you realize in order to be the best that ever lived have to change the
swing if you don't know about golf you don't change your swing when you're the
best
and he went and retrain himself because he has different rituals and other
golfers now many people are modeling these rituals to get better
it's amazing you know you look at somebody like Michael felt the 2008
swimmer 17 only two people i think in history if i remember correctly that
have gotten seven gold medals in one session and here's the guys got number
six centers belt he's exhausted and he's going in for that final swim
i'm sure you remember and how does the guy win by one hundredth of a second
do you think that was some massive skill that got him over the top
or was it a standard that says this is who I am I am The Champion and no one is
taking us from me and somehow those vinyls milliseconds hundredth of a
second he pushed himself just beyond its competitor but you know about Michael
Phelps what allowed to be able to push beyond that moment is its rituals
go study the guy most people who swim have these unbelievable workouts
he does two and three of the workout sessions a day all the other swimmers in
the beginning thought he was insane
you can / train you can't do that it's not physically possible but he had a
standard and the rituals to back it out
so here's my final message to you because I've gotten carried away i was
going to send you like a five minute message but you can see there's no
script here just need a little crazy with you but I want to really see you
get what you want this year don't let this year be like last in a flash to his
great stone to let it be that way raise the standard your life is perfect and
extraordinary you during well no you're not going to be happy unless you keep
making about it
that's what makes us feel like it's not what we get that make us happy it's who
we become
and what were able to give because we become more that sense of contribution
is what creates the deepest meaning
so here's my assignment for if you want one if you want to go from conversations
some action here simple thing to do
what's in your life right now that you really want to prove what's in there it
is important to improve your body's great how much career is great about
your relationship intimate one especially for your kids or your
relationship with your Creator spiritual side of your life or is it your finances
figure an area that really matters decide on that area number one
write down what your life is like in that area right now specifically as
possible so you might say well I'm 13.5 pounds overweight
you know whatever the way it is what the situation is my body fat like this or
I'm pretty wake up exhausted in the morning and you write the truth of where
you are right now
so you're real clear or I'm not in a relationship i say i want a relationship
but i am not in one I don't seem to find them all the good ones seem to be gone
is my belief
you know and I I really do want one but i don't have it whatever your definition
I'm in a relationship and god I wish it wasn't in a relationship
I'm planning my escape wherever you are or I have a lot of wonderful
relationship we love each other but there just isn't enough passion just
write the truth of where you are
the area you want to change but right how it is and then the second step is
this what you got to be really honest with yourself
what are the rituals that have put me there because whatever results you're
getting even if you don't like the results
there's some rituals that are keeping you in that place there's some rituals
of what you eat or don't eat how you move or don't move out you sleep or tone
sleep
there's some rituals and the lack of variety or spice or energy or focus in
an area
there's something you're doing and it's usually not one thing it's a bunch of
little things they kind of do consistently whatever you think about
getting a relationship whatever you think about working out whatever you
think about money and get yourself in a state of overwhelm you start thinking
about all the things you can't control
just write down all the rituals you have and then here's the third step what do
you want
what's your vision and be really specific i want to be my fighting weight
i want to be the strongest i've never felt I want to be I'm going to turn back
whatever it is be specific and then last step number four
what are the rituals that will get you there what would you do differently each
morning if you're going to be that kind of energy that kind of strength
how would you have to help me would you work out what days would work out what
time the ritual something you do consists
they usually at a specific time so it becomes automatic and I something will
be our doesn't last
the ritual is gonna last a lifetime how about you have some rituals in your life
right now you've been doing for years even though some of them don't serve you
and the same wake yourself up make you want a new year and a new life
you don't need to start in january first started a start with this little video
and just begin to see what happens and see how easy it is to just do a few
little rituals don't do them all just do two or three new things
you know what happens you'll get momentum because once you discipline
yourself and one of your life you feel yourself doing in other areas as well I
always say something that my original teacher taught me always remind people
there's always two panes in life there's the pain of discipline or the pain of
regret and discipline ways ounces is my friend jim rohn taught me regret weighs
tons
you don't ever regret so right now what do you want to change what's it really
like one of the rituals that got you there and I'll take a little homework if
you're not sure after people around you they'll tell you where your rituals her
what do I really want in depth of the riches that will get me there and then
get yourself to start a few of those actions and lock them in place so I can
help you in any way
we're here is a company to support you come to have an event with us come to
unleash the power within our master university or get a coach can get a free
coaching session if you call our company and click on something on this will
probably have something I need to get a product or don't do anything with us but
do something with somebody
starting with you if you make a change in yourself you're gonna be proud this
year and no amount of money or accolades from other people can mirror the feeling
of being proud of knowing you taking back control of your life or you takin a
great life to another level because once you do that you have something you can
give other people with your kids or your friends or your family and ultimate
that's why it's about
so thanks for listening and how long i went to hear but I hope this has been
helpful for us thought the new year and I want people to be able to truly create
a new life and new I see again probably substitute or get a chance to meet you
livestrong and let's live with passion and of course the bus to you
happy new year
