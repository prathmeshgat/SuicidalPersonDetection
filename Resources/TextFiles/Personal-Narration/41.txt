yeah
hello everybody I'm going to start with a question how many of you know the
person sitting next to you from before today
interesting
so do you remember the first conversation you ever had with that
person
your conversations are links
ok let's imagine every conversation to be a tiny metal link and every time you
talk to a stranger a metal inc is formed and every conversation that you have
after that moment the link gets stronger and stronger and every day
each one of us meet so many strangers the grocery guy the cab guy
maybe the reception is that a new office you went to with every conversation we
build new links until finally the end
we've created a kind of massive worldwide web of conversation
world wide web to catch e what I think I've heard that somewhere
that's it right a conversation it's a fascinating thing a conversation is an
adventure conversation gives you a whole new perspective a conversation opens a
door
the conversations can make war and conversations can make peace and
conversations define who we are as a human race
I think about this every single person in your life was once a stranger to you
and you knew nothing about them until you had that first conversation
so I'm here today to tell you to talk to strangers and to have a conversation and
i'm here to tell you how seven ways you can make a conversation with almost
anyone i am
a radio presenter and I love talking to people i do i love it and I'm so glad
that i do it for a living
she was one of my days life right every single morning I go into an empty room
and I put on a mic and I have a conversation with 1.6 million people
that I can't see ya
you know the hardest part is though it's time in a for our show
I get 20 minutes that's all the top there is and in 20 minutes
I have to convince you that I and your best friend
how do I do that how do i establish a connection i have 20 minutes to inform
you to excite you to engage with you but most importantly 20 out of 20 times that
I switch on that might I have to leave a smile on your face
except i can't see you I know nothing about you and I have no way of gauging
your reactions
how do you do it how do you talk to a stranger with my nine years and radio
have taught me these simple little tricks strangers
they are everywhere and we've always been told don't talk to strangers but I
beg to differ
every stranger comes with an opportunity an opportunity to learn something new
and opportunity to have an experience you'll never had or hear a story that
you've never heard before and you had that moment ray you're in the room with
someone you don't know and you look across the room
you see a stranger and you think I want to talk to this person and you can
almost hear the first word but it just want
mounted can get stuck about here it can go up and down and you don't know
you know what here's my advice just said what's the worst that can happen
they want to talk to you well they're not talking to you now
the first word that gets i truly believe that the first word acts as a floodgate
you know once you said the first word
everything else just flows to keep it simple
hi hey hello
and do what every good bowler does just gather the enthusiasm the positivity the
energy put on a big smile and say hi
I know there's going to be that strange moment right now
don't know someone sitting next to use your hand out and say hello
go on it
I love the awkward last the fish making up to do this
the first word blood gets you hear the challenge we face every day time we have
90 seconds on radio and we have to make that conversation with a stranger
memorable so how you do it what's the biggest challenge
honestly if we get stuck in the rot of high
hey how are you I'm fine
what's going on nothing much same old
so tell me what's new there you go 45 seconds down wasted
ok so here's my advice skip the small talk and ask you a really personal
question
and don't be afraid trust me you will be surprised how much people are willing to
share if you just ask
so ask any kind of personal question may be interesting name
how did your parents think of it is there a story behind it or how long have
you lived in the city and do you remember the first day
you will and you you see answers to those questions are always something
unique
always something personal my favorite one to try is where you come from and
where does your family live unfailingly every single time i sit in a cab
I do this I asked that question where you come from and where does your family
live let me tell you a little story
I was coming home one night and I got into the taxi
open the door sit down I see you when you from where does your family live and
the 60 year old pakistani cab driver goes on to tell me all about his life
and peace shall we talk about politics we talk about music family his wife his
farm and 20 minutes later he is convinced that i am the perfect bride
for his 26-year old college educated son from each other and as I'm getting out
of the taxi he's taking out a passport size photographs with this look of
enthusiasm
if I have to say it was a very difficult goodbye
but the moral of the story really is what starts with a Hello can end with
the marriage proposal and that is a warning
step 3 find the me to do is have you ever met someone who starts a
conversation like they're starting a debate
I'm from Delhi I hate delhi yeah
nothing kills a conversation like a negative when you meet someone for the
first time make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person
might have in common
when you start at that point and then move outward from there you will find
that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier and that's because
the both of you are suddenly on the same side of something and that's a really
powerful feeling now
what could you possibly have in common with a stranger you ask
could be anything right you're both in the same please
at the same time maybe you're from the same country
maybe you bought like the winter or your longing for it to rain
I don't know you find something when you find me do you automatically have a kind
of buy-in from the other person to ask me that said from be a unique compliment
i read somewhere that people will forget what you do and they'll forget what you
say but they will never forget how you made them feel to be generous and go out
and give someone a nice full complement
so i have this belief about a compliment immunity meter and it comes from this
experience I had when I met this gorgeous supermodel right and I look at
her and I say wow you're beautiful and there is no reaction on her face and I
think to myself how that's when I realized she's immune to the word
beautiful
she's probably ordered a hundred thousand times today and if she's on
social media
she's heard it a million times today there are some words that each of us
have developed an immunity to it could be nice
it could be awesome it could be cool
stay away from these try and construct a compliment that's unique and genuine and
you don't have to lie
really when you look at someone in sav i love how when you smile it's like your
noise smiles and then your eyes smile and your yours
my leaving your forehead smiling at me the whole person is just smiling
you see I hope that's a compliment you're not going to forget for a while
hey a unique and genuine compliment i asked for an opinion
all of us have opinions just me and we all want them to be heard and everybody
wants validation
so go on and ask for an opinion and that's when you open up a two-way street
that's when the real communication begins and you will be surprised how
much you can pick up about a person just by asking their opinion on something
pretty generic
she was a mistake that some people make the ask your opinion about something
really difficult
it feels almost intimidating summer in a room full of very well-informed people
and someone was to come up to me and say so what do you think about the way the
oil prices have affected the real estate market in Dubai
I feel a bit cornered
i feel like i might feel and this is an examination and that's the lesson
nobody needs to feel at a first-time conversation
just ask something simple keep it genetic
how do you like your coffee when was the last time we watched a movie what did
you think of it and when somebody gives you their opinion
really listen don't listen to reply
listen to listen there's a difference
and that brings me to my next point be present
I know you've been through this
I know I have you're pouring your heart out to someone and they're like this
yeah go on keep talking I can multitask
what's with the why fight when someone's trying to communicate with you
the least you can do is really be in that conversation just be wholeheartedly
present
just b day and all my favorite part
make eye contact trust me I contact is where all the magic happens
you can feel the conversation and trust me when you're looking at someone in the
eye
nine out of ten times they will not dare look away right
I have only I could look into the eyes of 1.6 million people i would not have
to worry about you guys tuning out during the ad breaks that brings me to
this
my favorite . because i think it's got to catching him named place
animal thing you remember that game
remember the little details about a person remember their name
it's so important it's also when you meet them on for the 18th time and you
see you must be Paul and Peter something with the P and it ends with it's
terrible
remember someone's name and see it back to them you have no idea how important
you are making them feel and that's not the only detail remember all the other
details as well
the places they like to go to the places they've been to the places they want to
go to that best names how their bets been feeling lately the things they like
remember their children's names that such a winner and remember their wives
names and their girlfriends name is just don't mix up the last two because that
could be disastrous
remember the little things about people and repeated back to them ask be
genuinely interested and automatically you kind of become an investor in their
well-being so they feel responsible to you to keep that conversation going
there we go seven amazing ways that you can make conversation with anyone and
seven reasons why you should use the brake that's going to come up to talk to
a stranger's if you don't know I'm going to end with this this analogy a
conversation is like leading a book you can go into any page you want you can
flip to your favorite chapter
you can read as long as you want and you can read what you want and every person
just me is a
really good book and it saddens me so much that entire human lives are being
buoyed down to 140 characters and catchy headlines because that's not what we are
we are not abridged versions
we are entire human stories we deserve more from each other
so what are you going to do in this big world that we call the library
I mean we're gonna walk it down and look at the hardbound copies and read the
titles or are you going to actually reach for book open a page and start
reading a story
you decide thank you
