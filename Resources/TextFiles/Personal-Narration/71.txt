hello there again everyone i think all of you already know my name is Helene
Robinson you got to know a little bit about my life in the previous speech but
today I'm going to be telling you about one particular of many life experiences
one that stands out most and made a big impression in my life was getting
married at 17 and yes I did need permission then we'll be in tune in
germany for two years leaving behind my family and friends and basically
everything I had known was one of the hardest things I've ever done and it was
all for a crazy unknown adventure but well worth it
it seemed like I was a younger one day and overnight I became an adult I had to
finish my senior high school while working a full-time job maintaining a
house and I had to cook clean do laundry grocery shop reality was tough i would
ask myself how did my mom do it all that she had three kids but she taught me
well
and although it took some time I settled in and began to embrace this amazing new
culture when I would go downtown it was like something i had seen on TV
the streets were all cobblestone and kept incredibly clean not like the
familiar streets of Brooklyn I was used to to look from left to right
each building was more amazing than the next
I felt as though I was on a movie so people everywhere walking around wearing
colorful authentic german clothing woman wearing tight corset tops and big
flowing skirts and the food
oh my god bratwurst and sauerkraut everywhere but not like you may have had
here in the United States there's no comparison
they would cut the ends of the italian bread like french bread hollowed-out
squirt some spicy mustard into it
then throw some crowd in there before they would stick the bratwurst in well
it doesn't sound like anything incredible but let me tell you it was
delicious i have never been able to duplicate it and believe me I have tried
the bratwurst was so juicy it snapped with every bite and the crowd was so
fresh you can tell it had never been packaged in Germany it was like a
celebration all the time everywhere with music and singing and lights so all the
excitement of the city was entertaining I still missed home so all the memories
not are stronger than that of my first trip home we surprise our parents and
family and I'll never forget the love in their eyes and their hugs that memory is
a constant reminder of no matter how far apart we are my family is the biggest
part of my life
so despite being challenged at times it was an experience that instilled a lot
of values of me and it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I
will forever cherish and I hope that each and every one of you all have a
personal experience that you to cherish and thank you for listening
how to stop it
