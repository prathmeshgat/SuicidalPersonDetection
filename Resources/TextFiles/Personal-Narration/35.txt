today I want to talk with you about a subject that many people have been
talking about for a very long time and that subject is called success
you see success means different things to different people
I was a success might mean to me is different than what it may mean to you
and what it means to you is different than what it means to kindergartener was
just trying to get a star on his homework assignment or perhaps to a
housewife who's been trying to get her five kids in bed by nine o'clock p.m. or
maybe even a corporate executive who's been working for his or her corporation
for 20-plus years and only wants to become the CEO of their organization
as you can tell we have so many different definitions of this word
success but the greatest definition i can give you today is this success is
all about self-expression
it's about being who you want to be doing what you want to do
going where you want to go because when it comes to your life you are the boss
and you have a choice
in fact you are who you are today because of all the choices that you've
made in your whole entire life
when you guys were growing up we have a lot of people who try to tell us how to
make these choices
our parents our teachers our bosses are friends
even our neighbors they try to tell us how to live our lives
what we should do where we should go how we should walk how we should talk
but my question for you is this if you're trying to be what other people
want you to be
then who will be you so the key to success is to stop conforming to other
people's expectations and start performing to your own level of
expectations is to believe in yourself is to know that what you want
will eventually come to fruition as long as you believe in it
you see you have to have faith and faith is knowing that what you want
will eventually come to fruition as long as you believe it
and if you feed your faith you'll find often times that your fears will starve
to death because if you believe in yourself
everyone else in the world will believe in you
fortunately for a long time I didn't quite believe in myself
actually I used to be the kind of person that mothers would often warned her
daughter's about and fathers would tell their sons
if you keep doing what Daniel Ali is doing you're going to end up where
Daniel Ali's going now they had some credence to what they're saying
because as you can imagine your reputation really is your best
advertisement
I really didn't have a good reputation because i was living so far below my
potential
that was actually living in my mother's basement but they just 21
I had worked over 40 different jobs I got fired for more jobs and more people
had in high school I graduated second to last the last guy while he was in jail I
was on drugs for eight years and i was confused
I was broke busted and disgusted and i knew that i wanted to change the only
problem was that i didn't know how can I see a show of hands if you ever been
this situation where you wanted to change but you just didn't know what to
do
well we all been there maybe we're there right now
why I discovered that there are only three ways that I can make change in my
life three ideas i wanted to share with you today that can absolutely
revolutionize your life from today
I know these tips work because I've been able to do it myself but age of 24 i
became a self-made millionaire
I've been able to write three books and travel to dozens of countries
I now reach millions of people with my work I believe that these three key
principles can change your life no matter how you define success whether
you want to live to age 100 or even have a dozen kids or just have a little house
in a mountaintop somewhere
no one knows about these three key principles will help you to realize the
success in your life
the first one is to read more books you know all the books in a world can help
us to solve all the problems in the world but the truth is that we don't
have to read all the books in the world because we don't have all the problems
in the world but we do have to read the books that help us to solve our problems
so for instance if you wanted to learn about money you better be learning about
reading books that talk about money or if you want to learn how to manage your
relationships or to become a better communicator
there's a lot of books on that what I'm saying basically is that our libraries
are paved with gold and library cards are free
you see books are the tools that release the heavens of your mind and leaders are
readers you see if you want to succeed you have to read most people in the
world read about one book every single year that book i would suppose would be
facebook and before people even get up and you know do their thing before they
drink their coffee or read their paper they read facebook but the truth is that
if you study
miscellaneous things you get miscellaneous results
you become what you study what do you study
and where is it taking you you see a lot of people come up to me and they say
well Daniel I don't really have time to read
I have kids have work I'm student already have so many text books i'm
doing so many things i'm too busy but if you don't have ten minutes a day
you're basically saying you don't have a life we all have time to read
we all have time to pick up a good book and read for ourselves so that we can
learn
look if you read 10 minutes a day for 30 straight days
that's one book a month one book a month and 12 months is 12 books a year you can
do in one year when most people do in five years
talk about not having time we all have time to read
remember readers are leaders and the only way you can succeed is if you read
my second suggestion
it's about getting around the best individuals you can you see where the
sum total of five people in which we surround ourselves with the most
we are in the same income we go to the same places we do the same things we
think the same thoughts and if you were to look at your five closest friends
you gotta ask yourself this one question who are my leaders and where are they
taking me
in other words are my leaders taking me to the place that I would most likely
want to be you see if the answer is no then you need two leaders
you need people who are inspiring people that can help you lift you up to the
goals that transcend your own possibility and you're thinking
you have to realize their goals and you can only do that by getting around the
right people
now many of us have what i like to call default friends and default friends are
basically people that we see around the neighborhood people at the grocery store
the gym the mall at church at work everywhere we go these are people that
we naturally befriend as we start to gain their trust and acceptance and what
tends to happen is that if you're a highly ambitious person and you have
really high goals
a lot of these people can't help you reach your goals
so you have to look outside you have to search for people
I'll give an example add a friend his name was John and he was actually a
plumber and his father and him had a pretty successful business
at least it seemed like it so is John you know I want to start a business
what exactly do you think I should do John pulled me to the corner he said
Daniel
I don't think you want to start a business ninety-eight percent of
businesses fail within the first three years then he proceeded to tell me about
all the reasons why I couldn't do it and why won't work
he told me how it was so hard working over 100 hours a week how hard it was to
manage payroll and why the recession was holding him back from getting more
clients as you told me this I became a little discouraged a little dejected and
I went home and I thought about it when i say when i got to my journal i usually
reflect and I wrote down in my journal that 98 /
sin of statistics are made up including that one
you see you have to realize that no one's opinion of you can become your
reality and in order to change your reality you have to change your
mentality and the people you surround yourself with you have to get yourself
around people who can help you people that are smarter than you
people have gone further than you people that know exactly what you need to do to
get to that next level
you see the truth is that the people that you're looking for are also looking
for you but you have to find them
you see sometimes we surround ourselves with strangers and family members who
tell us what we can't do they limit us and a lot of people have the right
intentions but oftentimes they provide the wrong directions
in other words they want to help us but they just don't know how
so get yourself around people who can a lot of people ask me what they knew how
do you find these people
it's easy if you follow step one which is to read more books you'll find that
in the back of the book there's about the author section and what I used to do
is I used to reach out to the authors
thankfully we live in a new millennium which allows us to get on your social
media their websites so we can have a conversation with them
we can change by actually understanding what it is that they teach and if we ask
enough questions we can make great progress in our life
remember the people you're looking for are also looking for you so get yourself
around those people
my last and final suggestion is to set higher goals because goals make you
stretch
they help you to become more of who you are and then this enormity of conformity
so many people don't know how to set goals they get confused about the
process a lot of people use a new year's resolutions but the problem new year's
resolutions
is that a person often tries to do too much too fast
so let's say Doug wants to stop smoking on a December 31st he says I'm done
genware first I'm clean never again
you see he hasn't created a plan of action to achieve his goals and
therefore it is unreasonable
bucket list is something else that people do and usually when someone
creates a bucket list
they're giving themselves too much time there's no urgency and most of the time
they don't write their goals down
so what do you suggest well I'm glad you asked what i do suggest for you to write
your goals down
I believe that a doll pencil is better than a sharp mind and to impress your
subconscious mind you have to write your goals down so that you can hold this
steadfastly to who you are
I have this method i teach all around the world is called the 20 idea method
and basically what you do is you select one overarching goal that you would like
to accomplish and ls20 ideas that corresponds with that particular goal
so let's say for instance you wanted to become a better public speaker
what are some things you can do well you could watch TED talks like you are right
now you can practice your speech right you can look in the mirror to challenge
yourself you can read the dictionary every day there's so many things you can
do but could i come up with 20 ideas and answer is yes i can come up with a
hundred if I wanted to
imagine if you did this in every area of your life financially for promotions for
your family and you wrote your goals on every day you'd be able to accomplish so
many things in your life
you see we have everything we need in order to succeed but we have to take the
things that we have to get more the things that we want from the cars that
we drive to the clothes that we wear to the food that we eat and the people that
we mean and this deposit or diversity we have everything we need in order to
succeed but we have to believe you see when you believe in yourself you'll find
that everyone else in the world will believe in you and you also have to
think big when you think big you'll do big and your win big
well big is actually the three ideas i wanted to share with you today be the
books that you read
I the individuals you meet Angie the goals that you set for yourself
books individuals and goals that's all you need to accomplish success because
when you think that you'll do big and you will when big my friends
thank you
