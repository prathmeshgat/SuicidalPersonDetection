my name's ever Nelson I'm doing it personal significant speech for my intro to public speaking class at Minnesota state may need 
if only I know if only I can you know that the love and support and encouragement you gave me about and 
I don't run your side thank you for the million times you've made a difference in my life 
author lance levels 
everyone has somebody who's made a difference in their life 
whether it be a positive experience or negative experience it is impacting on some way helped shape you know who you are today 
for me that person was meant 
my mom was supportive encouraging strong 
without my mom would not be who I am today 
my mom passed away four years ago from cancer 
she was not only my mother but also my friend 
she encouraged me everyday and help mission and helped shape me into the person that I am 
successful are and wife and mother 
when I was in college I would come home and tell her everyday how hard it was and it wasn't worth it 
she assured me that eventually in the end will justify the means 
you know what she was right 
if you have a mom you are right 
not only was she supportive but she was also strong 
some might say strongly opinionated 
anybody that knew my mom knew that she would always stand up for what she believed in 
no matter what the cost 
my mom helped shape me into being a leader 
in a world full of followers 
I am proud of the strength and the opinions that I may also share with my mom 
because without them I wouldn't be able to stand up for what I believed in 
it's like the old area depends on goals 
if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything 
even though she's gone she's not forgotten and either all of the life lessons just me 
as I said before everyone has somebody that has impacted them in some way shape them into who they are 
I want you guys to think about who that person is for you 
and then I want you to think that 
because without them 
would you be who you are today 
don't live your life with any regrets 
I think the people that have helped you 
helped you become who you are 
and I hope you never have to say to yourself 
if only I
