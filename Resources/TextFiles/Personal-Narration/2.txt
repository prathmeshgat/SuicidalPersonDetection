creating here's the audience 
well here goes probably one of the most embarrassing moment of my life 
it was Halloween and maturity kind may god technically mentality 
and birthday party with the classical DDT 
and and decided that we are going to go dancing and heather Graham 
all that we got there is already really badly and there's no rebranding about my date brat and my friend helping Steven and I 
if I got there and to go camping out on the balcony 
because they're look out energy more but easier 
so I don't know if there isnt 
there's really no way to date techno the kind where you know when your hair and finger 
I don't believe you before 
that we got there then I didn't know that without the balcony there that down 
from the main area and I have no idea 
no I'm falling right my day he's writing and I'm finally reading with me here in my face meanwhile 
and I don't feel that you are run off it in their land really part of my foot in the first thing to go through my head is not well accurately 
I'm dnmt 
I thought I'd be left in their thing in the throw myself against the wall 
but through it all the info I fly down in the computer room and grabbing hoping he would always start cracking up not you mn 
I can't ntfc they want to talk about it and they just relaxing I like you I knew I don't laugh 
so I think the down payment on my digicam you think interest like that all of the good 
I feel like a bad day if I'd left at that point and I kinda like the guy though 
who'd like to dance go back downstairs and I danced for two hours on my thing and I don't mean lonely really starting to hurt banding and I kept going back to the friend of mine on the nnat 
do you think I don't even we get that money back that's how we got there and take it back to the mall right 
so I'm in the back of probably ten to fifteen minutes 
and that's enough time for me to be off like that into realize how badly hurt actually what 
so my time I gave up trying to walk and would be 
really bad and relatively exactly are you Canterbury okay 
yeah I'm fine I didn I thought I could be great 
so I take him back home and I get that could not have growth living at that point 
and %HESITATION I can get there I have to have two girls held me up there and I'm going to finish to tad 
in the paper that was due the next day and it didn't happen 
but that only I can click on 
I went to bed and I need sleep at all and will go well got ethnic data crawl technical data getting my thighs and with the doctor and after awhile another brick in 
that would have left I learned that you know you know when you get injured probably take care of it holding it because like you make it a little bit worse than I have 
that that might be in then to prove to everyone today nnj 
here we go again
