it's this moment is no I'm looking at you and you look like a really nice
bunch has been such great energy i was sitting here for five minutes and it
just feels great this room and you look really friendly enough for it so thank
you and you're looking a bit unsure you know voice coach don't worry it's gonna
be fine and I can see a couple of really brainy Ted faces there and there's going
to be a few ideas to but it is this moment this moment is our worlds are
colliding right now you're looking at me I'm looking at you and it hits my brain
with a feeling of adrenaline accelerating molecules you might say and
different people deal with this moment differently some of us go
hey you know there are people who are confident they cope with this moment
totally fine
and then there are other people and not so confident and it stops them speaking
this moment makes them feel anxious makes me feel maybe they're not up to it
and that is not the case
actually all of us have confidence within and what I want to talk about
today is the idea that we can find more confidence within us if we know where to
look
and where do we look we go within we look under the bonnet
that's where we're going next
and the reason i want to talk about this is because many years ago I stood in
front of an audience this big bigger at central hole which is by the houses of
parliament
really big method space and I was super excited about that moment because I knew
that it was my big moment as a rookie voice coach and that i was going to be
able to speak and I stepped up in front of that audience and what happened was
everything that could possibly go wrong did I went too fast
I lost my words it felt like such a horrible experience and just as I
thought it couldn't get any worse
the microphone broke and I looked out across the room and i said in my big
voice coach voice
it wasn't this much wind at the time I have to say and i said in my big voice
coach voice can you hear me at the back and someone said speak up and I just
felt this feeling of absolute shame that feeling of an audience looking at you in
a feeling of judgment which cripples us and I left that venue and I thought to
myself never again now that clearly didn't work as I'm here I also thought
I'm gonna do it differently next time i'm going to make sure that the next
time I stand up to speak it feels good and where I had to go was within now we
live in a really visual culture we spend a lot of time if we think about two
worlds we spend a lot of time thinking about the outside maybe especially for
women and actually confidence doesn't exist on the outside exist within in the
visceral stuff in the best within you that we don't see and we're gonna go to
those bits and when I was thinking about this idea
three months ago when i asked to do it start to feel nervous about this moment
I start to think about a quote that the director Peter broke had said which is
that we open new drawers in the south
and I started to think about chest of drawers and then I came across this
really cool making George mcalary's actually sitting there and I said to
George can you make me a chest of drawers and he did
now you might be wondering what this object is and what this object is here
is what George made but when you ask and make it to make a chest of drawers they
don't always do what you think they're going to do you want to see what he did
yeah thanks George best response to the morning upstaged by the furniture and
within this little chest of drawers
this rather big manly chest of drawers is well are three secrets to find in
confidence within three lessons that I had to learn on the way now there's a
big lesson in here
the last lesson is the big one we're going to get there and it's not what you
might think it's a lesson that might surprise you but first would you like to
see inside the first rule
it's a bit delicateness
duels so what we have in here is an instrument because you've just been
hearing the voice is the most amazing instrument
it's magnificent and how often do you think about how yours works because like
this little guitar
it has a string and it has a hater where's the string of your voice hand on
it here give it shapes your Lawrence get everybody to do that for me
and then the hitter is the air now when you know that your voice is an
instrument what does that tell you
you know people come to me and they say I've got a bad voice I'm not a good
speaker
I get worried about this kind of moment I hate meetings I have presentations
can't do it
the voice is an instrument there's no such thing as a bad saxophone is that
because when we hear a great sex softness and he's probably somewhere
down here
what we know is that they've practiced a lot that not only do they have talent
but also that they have worked and worked and worked to get a great sound
now if you ever doubt the sound of your voice let me tell you all you have to do
is practice and when I was worrying about that moment i'm going to call my
central hall of shame because it was what I remembered was the story of a guy
in ancient greece called demosthenes that's a big old name so we're going to
call in the Greek dude from now on which actually is also a bit of a big words
they might just call him Dave I think that Dave was speaking at the ascent
which is like the 02 we have Simon in the room
it's likely the brixton academy of the Greek the ancient Greek world and he was
feeling pretty nervous he wanted to be an orator you know orders were the rock
stars of their day and so he gave himself up for this big moment at the
assembly and you know what
he bombed they said he was uncool in his speaking and that he's standard and so
the audience cheered and they threw stuff please don't do that today and he
left that stage feeling so downcast when he got a bit of advice from an actor
I'm sure great actors were pretty much the same as they are now and I'm sure
the actor was a bit like this but what he said to him is you need more
expression in your voice you just not giving enough well II it of energy and
you also need to believe in yourself because the message is good
so demosthenes takes himself back home and he goes for it this is his rocky
moment he builds himself an underground cellar
he shaves his head half of his head so that you can't leave the house for three
months and then he practices for three months solid in front of the a big
shield that's polished like a mirror and when he's ready when he's up there he
goes out he goes to the scene he speaks over the waves so he his voice has two
boo mouse over the waves and then he goes back he goes back to the assembly
and he speaks again and he becomes known as one of the greatest artists of his
day
so what does that tell you
it tells you about practice the power of practice
now you might not want to shave off your head you might not want to build an
underground cellar because the council might have words but what you can do is
practice and the simplest way to practice is to sing
you don't have to do a big mama voice coach warm up unless you want to
but what i really recommend is that every day
sing some wedding in the shower sing in the car thing on the tube if you feel
brave
I wasn't sir thomas's hospital for a blood test about two weeks ago there
were two women singing in the in the space where the blood tests were having
which was loved me so i recommend it
singing is the way to a great voice practice is the way to a great
instrument so that's lesson one
and we have another draw which we're going to open in a moment but before we
get there
I've got a question say walk into a room
ok you don't know anybody some of you may have had that feeling this morning
how do you know who the most powerful person in the room is the person with
the most confidence that in a confidence that we're going for here
how could you tell
how they carry themselves that's lovely lower and you get you know you're you're
in the same space and you because you're a singer and it is that how they carry
themselves and actually what an actor will tell you is that it's about the
breath the most powerful person in the room has the most relaxed breathing
pattern and there's a well-known scientist called Paulette man who looks
into emotion and he said which would make actors love because it seems so
straight forward to them but maybe isn't to science that he couldn't understand
why breath massive for a long time and he is his researchers explored it until
he started to understand that the unconscious system
you know I can't control my spleen is just doing its own thing but I can
control my breathing and if I get into my breathing i get into the unconscious
I can't myself down so what's within you is the key to this relaxed confident
power actors know this because when act as a playing King the king stays really
still everybody moves around the king and that's how you know the Kings in
charge
the next time you feel nervous about something try that try getting still now
within your body is something that is really the king of the body
that's what the Greeks called the center of all expression and I bet fifty
percent of this room have never thought about it
would you like to see what it is so
thank you my still handsome friend
so okay we've got our lungs
haven't we got this which is probably not an anatomical representation of a
heart but it's nice but what's down here
what's this thank you very much diaphragm
it is indeed your diaphragm now put your hands up if you have thought about the
diaphragm recently if you put your hands up if you thought about your diaphragm
today
Thank You singers in the room good or actors or sex or finance
put your hands up if you haven't yet thought about your diaphragm today
yeah that is quite a large percentage so we don't think about diaphragms do we
but the diaphragm is the key to regulating your system is how you come
yourself down in that moment where you stand in front of all the eyes
it will make you feel confident when you most need it and you at least feel like
it
now I didn't know anything about my daughter from I've learned about it I
knew what it was supposed to look like didn't know how it felt
and then one day I was feeling really stressed
I was breathing up in my chest you know I had that kind of squeaky high voice
adrenaline breathing up in the chest not good
I walked into a yoga class and the yoga teacher said you know really stressed
which is never a good start
he said lie down on the floor and he let me down and I close my eyes expecting
some lovely relaxing yoga thing and suddenly put a gym weight on my stomach
and he said breathe
lift that and I did I breathe in and as I breathe in
I had to lift that Jim wait with my stomach and my diaphragm shuttered into
action and suddenly I got it I got how it should feel
I got that I didn't need to breathe up here anymore that I could breathe down
and I'd like to suggest that the diaphragm is the king of kong
hence so should we find yours we take them and take your thumb and just put it
below your bra strap yet that's right so you got it
that's it and just some there and just gently push now Laurence Olivier when he
was taught to breathe Laurence Olivier you know the actor was taught to breathe
by pushing a grand piano
now I certainly don't have a grand piano at home London houses don't fit them
these things are they
but we can all practice the feeling of pushing a grand piano
if you breathe in and push your thumb away and now breathe out and feel it
push back
so you're filling up an air balloon in your stomach now breathe and push your
thumb away
now we that push it back welcome to your diaphragm and if you put your hands on
your ribs your diaphragm goes all the way around
you can also fill the rib cages you breathing so feel the ribs open as you
breathe and close as you breathe out if you are ever nervous about one of these
moments do that
your diaphragm is the key to your confidence
so we've got two lessons we've got the power of practice
we've got the importance of the diaphragm there's a third lesson which
is the big one
it's the one that really makes a difference and I started to think about
this lesson a couple of weeks ago actually because someone I've worked
with wrote to me she wrote me an email and she said she'd been through the
worst possible thing that you can imagine happening to someone she had
just got married and was on honeymoon when her husband had a heart attack and
died and she had to go back to the church they got married in and speak a
eulogy for this man
in fact she also read a poem that she'd written when they first met and she said
on the worst day of my life
I had to pull myself together I had to find the energy of celebration for this
man i really loved and the only way to do it was what you taught me the skills
of breathing low and slow
taking my time getting the control
finding the inner confidence it was the greatest gift I could give him and there
are moments in our lives where we have to speak
not because we have something to say for us but because we want to speak for
someone else a wedding a eulogy and i would suggest in those moments these
skills matter more than ever
and what you need to know in those moments is in this drool
its breath
it's and
and why air masses is because we breathe
our thoughts all speech is out breath all song is out breath and all in breath
is thought just put a hand back on that diaphragm for a moment and breathe out
and then feel the breath in and as you breathe and think of someone you really
love
now if we will all to speak on that out breath
it would be full of love now breathe in again and breathe in a feeling of
excitement for the day that's going to come because it's gonna be so good
and if we were to breathe in and then speak on that feeling then we have
excitement in our voices so you can control your voice with the idea of
breath is thought and it's in Latin the two worlds as ancient and modern the
Romans understood this inspiration and respiration have the same route
the Romans understood that we breathe
our thoughts and because we speak
on the out breath all you have to think about is the in breath and you know the
simplest way to think about the in breath close your mouth
so who would have thought that the big secret I promised you was that if you
want confidence in speech
all you have to do is know when to shut your mouth
thank you
