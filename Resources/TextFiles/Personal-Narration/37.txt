meditation has been a part of my life ever since I can remember
I personally have been practicing meditation for the last five and a half
years and I've been it
last eight months but I'll get into that a little bit later my college career has
been unconventional to say the least
I started out as pre-med and got halfway through my freshman year of college
before realizing that really wasn't for me and I switched my major about four
times before finally landing on international studies and eventually
choosing public health and I think it took me a really long time to figure out
what I wanted to do with my life for a few reasons 1 i'd always struggled with
self-confidence and I would set my standards for myself so high that any
time I failed to reach them
I felt like I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing instead of finding
strength from that situation I would beat myself up in falter and to my idea
of success and happiness and satisfaction up until recently were
completely misguided
we live in a world that encourages that this idea that in order to be internally
satisfied
we have to rely on external circumstances and this is an idea that's
been hammered into our heads
probably since we could understand what happiness and success and satisfaction
were and obviously these are concepts that are different for different people
at different times so it could be the little things like spending time with
friends and family or curling up with a good book or it could be getting good
grades
getting the job you want finding the person you're meant to spend the rest of
your life with
while all these things are great things we're still relying on things outside of
ourselves to make us happy and this idea of external substantiation has been
magnified with the increases in technology and the advent of social
media we can't really exist without our devices anymore it's almost like our
phones have become other body organs that we can't live without and with no
offense to anybody in this room but i can guarantee that the second I'm done
talking the majority will probably subconsciously reach for your phone to
check your texts and social media social media has created this idea of false
happiness and satisfaction
nobody wants to share that moment with their live no lives no one wants to
share their mistakes or their failures
social media has made it seem that everyone is always successful and happy
and satisfied all the time but what if things don't go our way
what if we don't get the great we want we
you know the person we thought we were going to spend the rest of our lives
with breaks up with us or we do get the job we want but there's some sort of
negative aspect to it like our boss sucks or we have a horrible coworker
suddenly the concept that was providing us with an internal site inspection
externally is now negative
so what I'm realizing more and more is that not only is our success temporary
but our happiness is conditional
we're only happier satisfied because something outside of ourselves as making
us happy and satisfied
we're never truly satisfied for the sake of being satisfied and that's when i
realized i was going wrong
so let me back up a little bit anybody who knows me knows that my entire life
I'd been on a one-way path to becoming a doctor
my whole family is filled with medical professionals and at the age of five
i declare that i was going to be just like them and of course my incredible
Indian parents let out a huge sigh of relief because they don't have to
convince me to go into medicine and for a long time that's what I wanted to do
until I started learning more about myself and my passions in my interest
and suddenly becoming a doctor was less of what i wanted to do and more of what
I felt obligated to do because my entire life I had been taught that in order to
be successful you have to be a doctor and I was always a weirdly compliant kid
I always knew my parents knew what was best for me so instead of finding the
confidence in myself to stand up for myself I went along with it
flash forward to my freshman year of college and I was miserable
I was taking classes that I hate it and I was doing poorly in them
the person that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with broke up
with me the second he went to college and I was still living at home so I felt
like it wasn't having the normal college experience and after years of having a
plan in a direction for my life all of a sudden I was lost and when you go
through hard times when you go through a breakup or whatever
everybody tells you to get out of the house do things for yourself and I did I
would hang out with friends i would go curl up with a book at a bookstore
i joined our Bollywood fusion dance team at school I again I would get a massage
but those were temporary satisfactions i would still come home and still feel
internally dissatisfied with myself and social media became the bane of my
existence I will see my friends and my ex and all my classmates posting
pictures of their new college adventures their dorm rooms their new friends
it's all these new things and I felt like a failure for a couple of reasons
one I didn't have anything to share on social media I was still living at home
I didn't feel like I was having the conventional college experience and to
as an Indian
I wasn't meeting the standard of success that had been dictated for me I wasn't
doing well to become a doctor but because i was all I knew as success
I stuck with it and my GPA and my self-esteem failed as a reason
so how did I change this how did i turn my life around
like I said meditation has been a part of my life ever since I can remember my
dad has been practicing a form of meditation called Raja yoga more yoga of
the mind for over 35 years and my mom started shortly after they got married
so just like people go to church or temple or synagogue meditation is my way
of life
it's all I've ever known and I always knew that I was going to start
practicing meditation at some point and I tried it a couple times my freshman
year of college but anything at that point that my parents that would be good
for me or would help me get out of the rut that I was in I was completely
rebellious against thankfully for me and very luckily i have incredible friends
and I have to show off pictures of these guys because they are my whole world
I was very lucky to have friends who were not only starting their college
careers or they were halfway through their college careers but they were
going through similar things that I was and they hadn't built up the resistance
to meditation that I had and one of my friends convinced me to go to a
meditation retreat when we can at first i cribbed and I dust and I wanted to
stay in my own little bubble of self-pity misery but in the end I'm so
glad I went because it was probably the best thing that could have happened to
me
so what is meditation I'm sure everybody here has a general idea in their head of
what it is but just to give a few more definitions
meditation is an exercise that trains your mind to regulate itself
it's the ability to focus on one thing continuously without break and it
practice properly and do diligently
it's a consistent reconnection with your true inner self and a lot of people
brush the concept of meditation aside because we think how we function without
our thoughts
how do we get through our day without thinking and another thing that people
don't realize is just like our bodies require physical activity to keep it
strong
and healthy and active our minds our muscles that also require exercise and
regulations to keep it strong and happy and healthy and active and a lot of
times people neglect their minds because they forget this . and if you think
meditation is hard
you are absolutely right it's very difficult to get your brain to shut up
for longer than five seconds and not think about something else and that's
another piece reason why people don't try it out
the first time I sat down to meditate it felt like every single thought I'd ever
had in my then 18 years of experience existence decided to come into my head
at that exact moment and no matter how many times I try to push them away or
ignore my thoughts are trying to get into a state of thoughtlessness
they kept coming back and I remember thinking why am I doing this
here's yet another thing in life that I'm failing at why am I even trying
the second time I sat down to meditate during that retreat
my thoughts decreased by a quarter the third time I sat down to meditate during
that retreat decreased by half and gradually it was as though i was
starting to see the world in high definition
not only could I see my external circumstances very clearly that it was
finally starting to see my true inner self with the objectivity and clarity
that I not had ever before and the practice of meditation that I'm a part
of prescribes meditating twice a day for one hour each time
so once in the morning for an hour and once in the evening for an hour and I'll
be totally honest with you guys it took me a very long time to get to a point
where i was consistent with this
some days i was doing a really great job and get up in the morning and meditated
go to bed and I meditate before before I went to bed I would meditate not be fine
but other days more bad days than good days
I would just be downright lazy and I would choose to stay up all night
watching Ellen videos and then you know seven
wake up late the next morning instead of meditating and my rationale for this was
like yeah i'm young i got the rest of my life to work on my meditation practice I
don't have more time to watch Ellen videos
but i think it took me a long time to read to connect with my meditation
practice because i wasn't accustomed to the silence that came with meditation
I think as humans we thrive on noise because it makes us feel as though we're
doing something and so I'd sit to meditate and about five to ten minutes
in i would realize i was craving noise I needed some sort of distraction so I'd
give up on meditating and I immediately reached for my phone or from my laptop
and what this taught me was I'd come to a point where I hated silence and this
also taught me how loud my world was and noises not just sound or cacophony of
noise is the frustration you feel with a family member or friend its writers
block
it's not understanding a concept at school anything is noise if it's loud
enough to distract us and one so I realized that I'd come to hate silence
it made me examine my routine and I realized I couldn't get it through a day
without sound or noise or distractions of some sort I would wake up in the
morning and i would meditate have hardly before giving up because it got too hard
and immediately reached for my phone or my laptop and I would play music and
videos while I was getting ready for school while i was eating breakfast i
would drive to school with music on
I would get to class and it'd be fine and then about halfway through class and
without thinking about the video I watched that morning and then be so much
chaos coming around me and in me because of my thoughts and all these
distractions that I'd come home and feel frustrated and let out that frustration
of my family members because I didn't know what to do with it and i start my
homework and feel frustrated because i wasn't understanding the concepts but
that's because I music on the background and then I try to sit down and meditate
at the end of the day and I'd give up again because there was so much going on
in my head and I get annoyed when I couldn't fall asleep and then I get
frustrated because I felt like I wasn't progressing in my meditation practice
so what this taught me was that in order to create a true connection with my
inner self had to learn how to love
silence and in order to learn how to love silence
I had to really use my willpower and commit to my meditation practice and in
order to sustain the love for silence that I'd cultivated internally my
internal environment had to interact with my external
environment and so the more and more i meditated the more I started to learn
how to love silence
internally the more my internal environment began to reflect my external
environment and that's when I started to see the changes in myself that I wanted
to see
so here if you how meditation creates interaction with the internal the
internal with the external confidence like i said earlier
I've always lacking in self-confidence the creating a consistent reconnection
with my inner self drove that fear of confidence away i suddenly i was able to
stand up for myself I was feeling more confident within myself and it gave me
the courage to eventually switch my major to international studies and
eventually get rid of this idea that in order to be successful I had to do
something big
replacing the positive with a negative
like I said before you know we may get the job that we want but there's always
going to be some sort of aspect about it that ends up becoming negative or
something that we don't want to deal with and all of a sudden the entire
environment becomes negative cultivating a connection with my internal self
through meditation has allowed me to see that the positive and any situation
regardless of what it is
exercise not just exercise of the mind
but exercise of the body when you're taking care of yourself internally
you're given the ability to take care of yourself externally as well
communication I'm seem like a talk a lot up here but I'm actually pretty not a
sort of most of the time and so by creating a connection with myself
through meditation constantly i was able to say the things I need to say speak up
for myself when I needed to minimizing stress and anxiety being able to create
confidence in myself maybe take on challenges without any worry or fear and
staying in the present moment
it's easier to live in the past it's more fun to live in the future but it's
better to stay in the moment and that's what meditation does for you
compassion tolerance acceptance being able to see everyone with as their true
selves because of reconnecting with myself and willpower
meditation is hard but if you could create the willpower to stop your brain
from thinking long enough you can pretty much create the willpower to do just
about anything
and the capacity to love as corny as it sounds
the more and more i was able to love myself the more i was able to love
everything around me
there was only one time in my life that I really straight away from my
meditation practice and that was when i was working on president obama's
reelection campaign
this is the day my dad and President Obama went public with their bromance
huh anybody knows anything about a campaign knows that the energy they are
so strong that you really don't need much of anything else to cog to sustain
you and I realized that I was trying to take the energy from this product from
this campaign and use it in my daily life but once again I was relying on
external circumstances to make me feel good internally
I got to do a lot of really cool things my senior year of college I got to go on
to study abroad trip to Europe to study human rights got you will be in our mod
right Stacey accredited Model United Nations team but it became less about
the big things that I was doing and more about committing to my meditation
practice committing to my internal self and making sure that all the values that
I created within myself were expressed and everything I did that I did what I
was supposed to do to the best of my abilities and when I was very fortunate
to get the internship with the United Nations I carried that same mentality
with me
so what I'm learning more and more is that we shouldn't have to rely on
external circumstances to make ourselves internally satisfied true success comes
when you take the time every single day to work on yourself internally and
cultivate the valleys that you want to see yourself internally and then being
able to hold on to those values and express them in any external
circumstance whether they be positive or negative one of my best friends for and
she actually just recently wrote a blog post about this
we think that change is gonna come to us as we get older we think will learn how
to cook when we move that we think will exercise more when we really need it but
that's not the case we will learn how to cook when we choose to learn how to cook
we will learn to work out and exercise when we choose to learn to work out and
exercise my internal sense of self didn't change until I made the choice to
change my internal sense of self and to me
true success is being able to learn about myself more and more every single
day with my meditation practice and use
and that and expressing it in any situation that I'm put in
thank you
