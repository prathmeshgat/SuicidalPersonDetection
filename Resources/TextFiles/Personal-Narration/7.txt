fineness 
you are pulled you are brilliant and you are beautiful 
there is no other woman like you 
you are capable 
factset 
see you pump it over my bra today 
but that's alright 
I managed to still love you 
and I think guys who are just so sexy you can't stop rubbing each other 
that's alright 
I'm going to keep you 
and so you lie I have not forgotten about you I'm gonna choose to love you even though you want to take over my whole bottom half but 
you're part of me 
I love you 
it's true I honestly 
I feel free once I realized I was never going to fit the narrow mold that society wanted me to fit in 
I was never going to be perfect enough for an industry that defines perfection from the outside in 
and that's okay 
rolls curves cellulite all of it 
I love every part of me 
my name is Ashley Graham 
and I'm a model and body activists 
over the last fifteen years 
I've come to the conclusion that there is no one perfect body 
because unlike you possess a wonderfully unique 
and diverse physique 
now the fashion industry 
may process the label me as plus size but 
I like to think of it is 
my side if 
in fact did you know that the plus size fashion industry actually starts at a U. S. size aids 
and it goes into a U. S. size sixteen 
so basically what I'm saying is that the majority of this room right now is considered plus size 
how that make you feel to be labeled 
I really feel like we need to start looking beyond the plus size model paradigms 
to what it actually means to be a model in two thousand and fifteen 
my journey begins in Lincoln Nebraska 
I was twelve years old and scouted in a mall 
at thirteen I signed with a model major modeling agency and was traveling the world's 
I was shooting big campaigns than before even %HESITATION graduated high school 
I had been to multiple different countries 
at seventeen I graduated and moved to New York and while most kids are going through their self discovery stage in college 
my self discovery stage was in the midst of catwalks catalogs and casting calls 
I was working as a full time plus size model 
back in Nebraska I was known as the fat model 
the girl who was pretty 
for a big girl 
I always dreaded hating I hated answering the question what do you do for a living 
I would see that person's eyebrow raises I would reply I'm a model 
I have to quickly qualify with well I'm a plus size model 
in fact here's my very first editorial for YM magazine 
and you're reading it correctly 
cantaloupes large breasts 
I was hoping that women across America at the age of fifteen to rest their big boobs 
but you know what the first thing that someone in middle school pointed out to me besides outside the obvious 
was that fooled above my knee 
that sap fold above my knee 
as a young model my confidence was tugged and pulled in all different directions 
I struggle to achieve true confidence 
I would go home and look in front of the mirror and only hate what I saw 
and to fill the void on the inside I began to cater all devices being thrown my way 
between the parties the man alcohol 
I was looking for self love affirmation from somebody when in reality I didn't know who I was and I couldn't seem to get a handle on regulating my own weight 
I began to 
thoughts as I began to face my insecurities had on 
and instead 
I was feeling my life with temporary fixes 
I like so many young women have struggled to love who I am 
and diverse global report on attitudes towards beauty actually did a survey 
two with thousands of women 
in ten different countries 
and you know what the most striking result was 
that only two percent of women find themselves beautiful two percent 
we need to work together to redefine the global vision of beauty 
and it starts with becoming your own role model 
as a curvy woman it was the assumption that I should look up to Marilyn Monroe or Jennifer Lopez 
mainly because they were two of the most notable curvy women in the public eye that were being praised for their curves 
but these were my role models 
in reality the woman looks up to the most was my mother 
she told me I was beautiful 
and she never devalued herself 
so why would I 
she told me and taught me 
that true beauty comes from within and that validation and self worth must also come from within 
in my lowest moments of insecurity this is when I realized that I had to re claim my body and its image as my own 
plus size fashion is an eighteen billion dollar industry 
and now I am Gee 
the world's number one modeling agency 
has signed me and other models that are not defined by their size 
my body like my confidence has been picked department if you waited and controlled by others who didn't necessarily understand it 
I had to learn to reclaim my body as my own 
and in reclaiming my body as my own I understood as a woman that I had a greater purpose 
I had a greater purpose 
to redefine beauty 
the feminine beauty 
curvy models are becoming more and more vocal about the ice leading nature of the term plus size 
we are calling ourselves what we want to be called 
women 
with shapes that are our own 
I believe beauty is beyond size 
with so much emphasis on the body in next hurdle it's no wonder that we all suffer so much internally 
but you know people in the fashion industry actually told me that I would never be in magazines let alone the covers of them 
well I guess the proven them wrong 
five covers in a little over a year 
and 
I was one of the very first thirty miles to be featured in Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition 
thank you 
never let anybody 
tell you that you can't 
I have achieved and I'm still achieving what was seemingly impossible 
my goal is to give a voice to young women 
to give a voice young women who struggle to find someone they can look up to 
for girls who struggle to look inside the mirror and say I love you 
for women who feel uncomfortable expressing their confidence 
they've locked away inside themselves 
for women who have relinquished their rights to someone else 
it is critical that both men and women create a body positive environment 
Abu list the important women in your lives create a safe space for them 
to express their body and their beauty for who they are not because of who they are not 
be you 
be real 
be authentic 
be your favorite kind of woman 
don't let anybody else take that job 
and remember this is the generation of body diverse city 
the current is changing 
I now invite all of you sue has tags had XP V. fifteen 
with your own self affirming words 
there may not be a full length mirror in front of each of you today but 
I want to challenge you to think about what you would want to say to yourself in the mirror 
with your own self affirming words 
thank you
