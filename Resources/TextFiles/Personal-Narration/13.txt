umn like a lot of people are getting involved in martial arts or fighting system German military and law enforcement from a very early age as early as I can remember I've always been interested in %HESITATION swordfighting %HESITATION retarded became popular in the fifties I was very interested in that snatch user early mid sixties I started collaborating for starfish Walters also roughly nineteen sixty two but it was a means of expression of interest I have to start much earlier a little room color and she'll breastplate I got when I was five years you know absolutely for all that you can't really say wonder how I started or why I was always interested aspect yeah like I said karate became something that was actually accessible in this country %HESITATION in the fifties %HESITATION I'd seen it a little bit that Morrison called jujitsu albums you know by sixty two I was actually start on login or signup system was not a class system %HESITATION mid to late sixties I got involved with a Japanese karate teacher from Japan nnj who was a west coast 
very president of VisualAge primarily work 
watching 
all the 
and 
I was 
part of that was 
part of that training 
certainly 
heavily tied to 
seventeen 
primarily 
%HESITATION 
yeah it was 
problems 
especially 
easily 
George 
for all my 
their move to Hawaii to go to school 
why 
told 
and 
people involved 
still primarily 
so it's kind of an evolutionary process there are state in Hawaii 
%HESITATION 
early mid seventies I've met 
by the name of don draper 
and it was straight or who you know I I don't read all she was a 
use of World War two Aeromarine 
%HESITATION officers marine corps during the Pacific War career 
%HESITATION he was retired out wrist out in nineteen 
six 
but what about him %HESITATION it was actually really seventies 
%HESITATION maybe seven four seven five 
somewhere around there ideas doing research that that was 
that was a new field commander technical talking walls 
%HESITATION 
trigger was easily the most influential person on the map purity on 
use a family of 
total physical capabilities genetic freak in that regard but he was also 
%HESITATION very very intelligent he was very good 
%HESITATION field worker in 
Polish your furniture mn 
%HESITATION 
and he was a judo way back I think you started you know with %HESITATION 
well that was nineteen thirty seven 
so that was his first love 
when he retired in fifty six he actually retired incompatibility retired members first professional marine officer 
and his interest in martial arts got beyond bureau which was well aware is primarily a source 
so he had been introduced by teachers in Japan 
classical battlefields 
and that's 
that's where his primary orientation was more more directed 
%HESITATION so we started looking at the classroom level 
we live you can 
like trigger which 
nineteen seventy six nineteen seventy seven sexually under his 
insurrection 
he had just formulated the international problem 
center several other foreigners working in Japan at that time 
%HESITATION 
at that time is when I when I became influenced by looking at 
martial arts dnmt 
objective critical thinking approach 
not right Charlemagne 
to 
so you know I have certainly my biases nndb 
somebody with a sword 
a lot of a lot of solutions went home with rules 
the myths of copy 
the more pressure more I have to be looking 
because of his nd 
yeah classical ballet 
at the same time dnmt field research 
mostly well Malaysia 
lladro 
Tyler 
and 
I was introduced to other parts 
is that just 
I previously my own field research 
without just 
Taiwan Hong Kong so 
so it was during that period regulations 
I started thinking about things from more class actions 
it was a bad 
hello again xn 
slowly switching over from the modern concept of martial arts IT 
Japanese user term again and I 
can directly or things like problems you know 
no 
you know 
%HESITATION 
classical systems what they call the cool you were cool 
cold literally means or 
were 
I didn't know about that until later introduced 
I started looking around 
we strongly suggest that 
anybody who's going to work hard all 
field of study dealing with combative behavior 
have to understand that 
and it is at first I was a little bit resist the idea because being a cop and I was 
also view the concept of anti Hanford was way to go 
and slowly it's this time off-again 
okay very obvious 
humans are not 
we have four albums we've always been wanting 
the only times we finally fight without weapons society force 
which is primarily the last 
seventy years what's 
most will still use 
certainly early man 
fox 
so far 
so it is a happy camper njih and concept 
mistress 
this comes 
and that was not helping me look at well 
so 
I also became involved classical Japanese battlefields 
now the idea was to be 
Schrager stressed 
%HESITATION 
the Japanese battlefield systems were still being maintained Japan they weren't storage system 
and at that time they were not being influenced by modern concepts martial arts or you know how we should trade in modern society they were based on 
traditions methodologies 
the general sense of Japanese about Paris 
shortly they were fast idea initially came %HESITATION started introduced to tradition possibly 
which was battlefields 
and do other circumstances later I became involved 
Carter 
yeah outdoor show nnj 
and it was actually Chicago you have a spare tradition 
only because 
waffles for Chicago 
was very prominent 
battlefields 
and tradition 
through the %HESITATION workstation 
so that was
