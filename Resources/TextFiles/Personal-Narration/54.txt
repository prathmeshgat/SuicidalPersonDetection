at the rodeo
you hear me
and not usually a problem
what do you think of leadership in life lessons you don't thoughts don't
normally go to where I'm from but I think you'd be surprised where I'm from
is the boonies
Webster defines the boonies at the location so far outside of the city
limits even animals question your president and I've lived there most of
my life
louisiana mississippi Oklahoma Texas Arkansas
it did not matter my parents nomadic Southern Baptist that they were always
seem to find the boonies in every state but for the purposes of this
presentation
the booties were in Texas to give a little insight into me you first have to
understand my father he's a man's man he played football in high school he was a
paratroopers army
he was always kind of her all the time I refer to my childhood as my military
service in the summer before the 7th grade
it was a bleak hot Texas day as every day in Texas is and my father said get
the triple / want to tell tale
we never got to go to town town was but go to Texas population 491 and we live
seven miles northeast
the town was where things were that's where the stuff was you get a root beer
float in town
you can get tater tots in town I said sign me up i got in the truck
but we didn't stop in 10 we kept going through tail out to the high school and
that's where i was introduced to football and two a days which is a
vicious heinous practice twice a day
football practice what kind of crazy fool came up with that in Texas but I
participated in it
you can imagine how joyful I was my father's day going out there boy asked
that i am going out there
no well actually I said that in my head what I really said was yes sir
because if you do as you're told you'll survive
my father didn't actually threaten to shoot me in the face but it was implied
I walked up to the crowd and the coaches were dividing us in the group they said
you go over there
I said one let's see your alignment what's alignment
you're gonna protect the quarter bag but who is this quarterback why do I want to
protect you
they said just get over there I said why me they said because you're fat because
girls substitutes for talent in junior high football
however I discovered it is possible to actually play football without any
physical contact whatsoever
there was a whole lot of down said he'll get him because I wasn't about to get
hurt
I'm live for special teams kickoff return punt return you can run you can
run that and not touch your soul and get so good Hospital Thompson looking good
and I'm thinking you don't know from hustle I'm trying to survive out here
I played for two years and i decided i had enough so i told my daddy
I'm not playing for Baltimore they get your I said no he said you play so I did
what any red-blooded American man would do I would cry to my mom please let me
quit football he said did leave him alone
let him be and overheard my dad is a what's wrong with that boy mom she said
just leave him alone he's trying to find himself
and he said well he better hurry up he's about to piss me off so I tried new
activities because there are very few injuries reported in marching bands and
honor societies
I tried to do music
I even tried new clothes I went through an unfortunate . what i wanted to be a
Madonna backup dance with black clothes and hair down to here and five watches
if you remember the eighties how you remember me but I will still where I was
from
so I had to go to activities such as a 48 stock show & the rodeo
unfortunately was during my prep phase is finding yourself sometimes but it
sometimes does but never should in with somebody wearing penny loafers to the
rodeo
all it did was here take my daddy and piss off Merle Haggard
so I stand before you with what I call redneck light
I'm still from where I'm from but I'm educated and I'm embarrassingly
ambitious
I'm an LPA my relatives call me up buddy
but i have remained true to myself because success comes in many shapes and
sizes and sometimes it comes with color coordinated socks
and that's what I've learned from where I'm from
