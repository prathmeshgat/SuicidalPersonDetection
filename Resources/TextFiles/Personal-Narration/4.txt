yeah fineness dnmt fon back in New York I am the head of development for a nonprofit called Robin Hood when I'm not fighting poverty time fighting fires is the assistant happen with volunteer fire company 
now in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire seemed pretty early to get in on any action 
I remember my first fire I was the second volunteer on the scene so there's a pretty good chance I was going to get it 
still it was a real foot race against the other volunteers get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would 
what I found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life 
here it was the middle of the night 
she was standing outside in the pouring rain 
under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames 
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let's call him 
lex Luther 
fineness got to the captain first and was asked 
to go inside and save the homeowners dog 
my dog 
although I was stunned with jealousy here was some lawyer money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building 
to save a living creature 
just because he beat me by five seconds 
well 
I was next 
the captain weighed me over 
Basil's I need you to go into the house I need you to go upstairs past the fire and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes 
I don't 
as for 
so 
not exactly what I was hoping for but off I went 
up the stairs down the hall past the real firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point 
into the master bedroom 
to get a pair of shoes now 
I know what you're thinking 
but I'm no hero 
nnj 
I carried my payload back downstairs for I met my nemesis in the precious dog by the front door mn we took our treasures outside to the homeowner where not surprisingly his received much more attention that did mine 
a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home 
the act of kindness 
she noted above all others 
someone had even got her a pair shoes 
you know in both my vocation a Robinhood my avocation is volunteer firefighter I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale 
but I'm also in the stacks of grace and courage on an individual basis 
I know what I'd learned 
they all matter 
so as I look around this room it people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success 
I would offer this reminder 
don't wait 
don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life if you have something to give 
give it now 
Sir food a soup kitchen 
clean up a neighborhood park 
be a mentor 
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life but every day offers us an opportunity to affect what 
so get in the game 
save the shoes 
thank you dnmt
