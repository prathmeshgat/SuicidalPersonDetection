ok so the time I started off I have 17 minutes firstly good afternoon and
welcome back have you guys had a good meal
great and I'm still hungry because I was trying to fix this presentation so I'm
not a presentation guy right
that's not something that I wanted to do when I was growing up but it's dead x
man that's a big deal guys
yeah so I did he what you guys play sports do you guys play games
great so now we play a little sport ok it's not really a sport it's a little
game
what we're gonna do right now is whether try and spot the difference that is my
first slide and can we please have the magnifying glass and ish
thank you so yeah so we're going to try and spot the difference right what I
want to do is in the next twelve thirty not minutes I want to try and unravel my
life in front of you guys because it's not been easy right
but the one thing is I'm doing something which anyways we'll get to that later
so let's move on and let me tell you guys who I was was his who am i today
so when I was a child that's me by the way baby photo girl do you think I'm
cured here right
so when I was born man the doctor at the hospital actually wrote mule child
instead of male child and my mom had to add that extra bit on the top to make it
a meal and say I a male child I was I don't know why you so mean
yeah she's smiling in the front so yeah you know when I was a child of a naughty
use very mischievous just like everybody else right and I was to another level I
was mad was mentally so my mom decided to send me to a boarding school and then
I went to the boarding school for seven years I had the same bunch of friends 45
people in one class
Junior's we wouldn't talk to them because you were too cool and the only
thing that i did was i imitated people
those are my teachers no actually they looked a little better than that
and as a child the only thing that I want it was I wanted the spotlight
everybody should be around me people laughing around me the girls that this
the data that was my first time on stage by the way
zoo chief apparently is too fair to be the zoo chief and my sexy legs as well
so then I grew up and pure I am I still think i am an ass like the middle child
and you know the people who got pranked by me they'd be able to tell you better
that's me so I'm still as naughty as i used to be i love what i do and i still
limited people man that hasn't changed too much right it's just that the
repertoire has gotten bigger
today it's not the you know teachers but it's the call center by the politician
the cop the you know banana chips LOL it's just everybody basically and I do
have the spotlight today I do have the spotlight today and that's exactly what
i think i will be able to convey to you guys because when i started off
that's something that I wanted when I am today I still want it
I'm not done with it right but this is one difference
do all of us have mornings in our life yeah we have mornings in our life right
so earlier my mornings used to be like this listen to it
in morning
how are you just fine
howdy how do you do hello
hey idea right good morning in this
yes all of that but and today my mornings are like this soup body
nothing today and Aaron
right now the only thing is my good mornings have become great mornings and
there's a reason to that which i will tell you now because who i am is what i
do when i was a child and then you know I was in school and my teachers would be
around my family would be around every day the public the sunday monday
independence day and you ready investiture ceremony every day I used to
be the MC
that was me with acne on my face and it still put me on stage I don't know why
today as well
I still AM an MC nothing's changed
nothing has changed and when I was a child I used to do theater
you should love being on stage of a scrawny then I'm still doing the same
thing i do something called the improv
the third thing which I'm known for today is for being a prankster
so that was me like yours ago man
but I was a child wearing my sister's flock I tried to prank my mom
by making a believe I my sister what was I thinking
but today of course i'm doing the same thing
and the reason why my life has become from good to create is bickers I could
feed to do the same nonsense
unbelievable right i mean just think of it
well you don't really think of it right as a child who never taught you get paid
to do it and it's unbelievable like my first video job
it was in Bahrain I hadn't even heard of partying
I used to own 15,000 India's or event manager
I show up there and my head I'm thinking 15,000 w 30,000 i will live in - 15,000
build a house back after six years ago that the ideal
I'm not even Molly but i don't know why i was thinking like them yeah it's a
little it's it's a little stupid then of course i decided to move to dubai work
there for some time to pick the axons there you know where the our backs in
then the other moms her you have the Filipinos and then you have the French
and blah blah blah
so I picked up Max's then I realized what I wanted to do is what I've always
been doing as a child that is that all done is saved the MC the actor the
prankster and i'm glad i'm doing that today so just to give you an idea of
what exactly do for a few people who probably to the boy and all my place
when I do baked mr. much you actually came forward with that i'm calling on
the set of a center set

it depends on how you look at yourself go back home today take a piece of pen
and paper and write down whatever you wanted to do as a child
see if you're doing it today my present is a result of imitation don't imitate
someone I could do it as a child and that's what I'm doing today
but you guys make yours the result of instinct see what you have within you
and see how you can put it the best effect
I just want to wish you guys luck god bless you all doing in life
