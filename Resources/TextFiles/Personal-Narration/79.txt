the average person in the UK has any 11 weeks income saved in the bank
how much do you have saved how long could you live for if your paycheck
stopped coming in
maybe you never thought of that and it might be a little bit scary to to think
about today i'm going to share with you about passive income and how to design
your dream life through building up your passive income streams designing your
dream life through passive income that's got a big claim me like why is passive
income important to us and what is it
well in October 2012 i knew absolutely nothing about passive income i was here
it's like you said I was at B Block don't uni and I knew nothing about
passive income i knew that how to make income i knew that you go and stop your
time for money
that's called active income or earned income and it's what you you do when you
get a job and that's what 99% of us in the world do the opposite of that is
passive income or recurring income it's where you do the work once and you
continue to get paid recurring Lee for very little or no actual work when
you're passive income the recurring income exceeds your cost of living
what you spend on you know food utilities petrol that kind of stuff when
you passive income exceeds or your cost of living at your then financially free
and if you happen to lose a job or not get a paycheck you can live infinitely
forever
now why is that important so this is a question get ready for Miss have some
audience participation
can you think of reasons why your paycheck would stop coming in you break
a leg perfect so you're you're sick or you're incapacitated you're unable to
stop your time for money thank you
anybody else get fired fantastic perfect is anyone been fired in the room
ok perfect anybody else got any other other ones yeah
or so that that's a really really good . so your industry changes that could be a
global financial crisis or it could be organization you know things like that
lame brother collapse or or you know via the mining industry or steel structural
changes that can affect effectors and that might have nothing to do with your
competency at your job
you might also be taken over by a new firm you know it's a merger and their to
view the same job and your made redundant or maybe just fall out of your
boss and Annie you know ask you to trot along the way and it may not actually be
due to your competency whatsoever
that's not a great position to be in is if your financial security is
effectively based on circumstance or things that might be out of your control
so when I was at uni I just finished my second year I got a first which was
great
nppe and I i tried it took years to get to uni I tried banking activity group
and carry off i tried accountancy I tried law i tried sales IT sales PR then
I tried procter & gamble and I had this long list of proper jobs of what i
thought i should know respectable people that they're gonna do these things i
will try to work with children and and i enjoyed you know I I didn't dislike the
jobs i like the people I was working with so if you're watching but it's
happening garden but it didn't like me up I couldn't see myself spending the
next 45 to 50 years
so what are you on the retirement age nine hours at 65 or 67 and you know what
happens when we get to that age and how i'm hit 75 80 a hundred who nice and i
couldn't spend that the next 50 years of my life doing this thing and and I
remember procter & gamble they said to my final day in in-home been park in
harrogate and they said we want to offer you the job when you finish uni but
we're not quite sure if it's right for you and I thought will know how to take
their and they said just just pop out the room will bring any other Boston
what we'll have a chat and when I came back in that I was smiling and they were
like what what you doing smiling with that would be sort of saying we don't
really want offer you the job
and I said no one has ever said that to me I thought in my head I thought I
can't do this but i didn't know that there was an alternative and it took
someone else to say it to me to sage and I what they're right I can't do this so
scary that was it's like I'd shut that door and now it was like will start
something fresh what can I do so I went home that night and started googling as
any self-respecting person does when they're the faster the next to you know
a life crisis they jump on google and I'll i started discovering terms like
how can you be your own boss passive income wealth creation and words I've
never come across before i started to read and I've read about real-life case
studies not billionaires are these incredibly talented people people normal
people who had picked the strategy there are lots of ways of bringing in passive
income is property but there are lots and they said about taking work that's
taking action is it get rich quick overnight know if anybody tells you it
is the only way of doing that is the lottery
alright so but it can be get rich fast you know whatever that is for you months
years it doesn't take long
continual sustained action can get you the results you want so I read a load of
books thought great and they asked me master like you know I was like yeah i'm
just reading other stuff and I went along to the users or I chose property
resume to a neighbor said you don't have to pick property went along to these
events where I met normal people and remember court river and or normal guy
came across property boom we had 36 year old houses whatever it was and I was
that what he can do it I can do it too so I spend my student loan and i took a
credit card and I invested myself to learn what what to do and i invested in
myself and to cut a long story short i started with no money and I had no
knowledge or or education in in this kind of stuff and two years later I had
paid off every investor i borrowed from and 24 houses with the poor fellow a 3.5
million quid and I want to national awards now that doesn't mean I'm special
tool i think the biggest thing I want to get across as anyone can do it its
strategy you know if someone happens to get a degree it doesn't mean that
they're not an absolute legend they just done what they've been told they've
locked up the classes they've done the homework and they've got the result
whether it happens to be the first or 21 or 22 you get a degree and it's the same
with wealth creation stuff some people are blessed with natural ability and
that might get going to get there a little bit quicker but anyone anyone can
achieve the same results and the reason i wanted to to get into this stuff was
because I didn't enjoy didn't like three hours heading down and unfortunately
people in the UK sixty to seventy percent of people don't like their job
sixty to seventy percent of people don't like vegetables and all that and all
that third of them hate their job out of a hundred people whatever is in this
room 25 people hate their job but you don't have a choice if you don't know
anything different you have to go and swap your time for money you've got
bills you've got a mortgage you gotta look after the children you don't have
an option and often we work so hard in the day that that when activating the
end of the day or we don't have a headspace to start thinking about other
things and I didn't want to be in that position
the further you are down the line you know for your students out this is the
perfect time to take action now it's really you've got the time to really
check this stuff out because i found that the old people get what they tend
to maybe have a few more limiting beliefs all barriers they still ever has
the same ability in fact all the people are more ability they have because they
have more life experience but there might be other commitments there that
that block them in their brain from from doing it and that's the hardest thing
you need to overcome is your limiting beliefs in your head so passive income
it from properties one way but you can choose network marketing like you know
forever living or utility warehouse that kind of stuff and you start to sell you
then build up the people selling for you eventually they're all making money from
you when you're not doing any work you've got affiliate marketing we drive
traffic to websites and you make commission off all the purchases well so
we got owning a business so you're not working in the business you're not
self-employed if you're self-employed
you're not really a business owner because you're still stopping time for
money like a like a plumber unless they've got a firm where they oversee it
and people are running out doing that the work for them are you still stopping
time for money you've got Amazon where you at you can set up business and we
buy products and try and sell them over here and obviously make make commission
on that property is another one there there are loads of different ways of you
generating passive income so the other thing i want to say as those of you have
got money in the bank or or maybe not in the river watching a little bit further
down the journey often we're so busy on focused on earning the money we're not
focused on what to do with it and there's it you know Albert Einstein
called the eighth wonder of the world com that the compounding effect so a
little bit of action if you're young you know a little bit of sensible investment
or making that money working on a few adds up to something really special
over time and that doesn't need to be risky or or you know it's going to end
in tears if you're smart you can make that money work really really hard for
you and that's not just coming to investigate me or and had another load
of ways of doing that so in terms of it the how to's and i'm not going to talk
today about massively about all the ways you can do it i'll put my blog up sign
up to that and we can i can send you more about how to's on what's right for
you based on your income or where you're out all the time you have but the main
thing I want to get across to you is what happens if you don't focus on
building up passive income so you're predictable future is where you are
right now you're probably if you're a student and you're probably lying up a
job in the future or if you're got a job at the moment and that's not going to
change and that's not a problem at all
not a problem until but you may want something different you know do you want
to be working for if you love your job
that's awesome and you know keep doing what you do that that's fantastic you
love it and you're very much in in the minority of doing it but have the
security and the peace of mind and the freedom that if your desires change or
if your circumstances change then you don't have to do that job anymore if
it's not there
you don't have to worry so if you're sick if you
well if you get fired if your job changes or industry collapses there's
not a problem or if you're looking for a sick relative
what happens if you do get your passive income now probably some of you remember
thinking fancy car big house all the material in a fancy logo on t-shirts and
stuff is cool right it's fun and it's great and for some people that means
more than others
I think the biggest thing for me is to ask what would you do with your life if
money was no object if you didn't have to swap your time for money
what would you do would you travel would you go and learn to surf in Hawaii or do
yoga in India or go and help an orphanage in Cambodia what would you do
what are you passionate about and that's maybe not something we we ask her ask
ourselves a lot because we don't see a way to to achieve that
so for me my my travel my passion is all those things traveling helping others
doing stuff like this and my dream is that all people will be able to follow
the heart you know whether that's a musician or an author or an artist you
can follow what you love
irrespective of the paycheck and you know you've got the financial stuff
sorted by picking one of these strategies and doing a few hours a week
and compound effect of that you don't have to worry if you're financially
successful you can follow your heart and for me that's really really exciting
Stephen kovy has got a great quote which is before you climb the ladder make sure
it Scott leaning up against the right building and its really interesting when
i was at union at school I i had the you know the proper London jobs lined up or
or heading down that route but and like i said before the further up the ladder
you get maybe the more reluctant you are to step step off at $TIME so if you
haven't started if your student now is the perfect time for you to really think
what it is you want to do and if you are further down the journey now is the best
time for you to ever think about that it's not gonna be in 5 years or 10 years
you've got to think about that stuff now
so to summarize today's talk we discussed what passive income is so it's
not stopping time for money is doing the work and getting paid for ever from it
we discuss why we need it to safeguard you in terms of safeguarding from the
negative stuff but also giving you the ability to design a life that you dream
of and to to choose what you want to do with your life and for for a lot of us
that's not something we've ever really thought about it may seem risky you may
have limiting beliefs I certainly did I was 23 I had no money I had no
experience i was at uni and I I didn't want a job I didn't know what on earth
today but with a little bit of Education and action
you can do whatever you want to do whatever you're limiting belief is maybe
you are too old or too young whatever but that's one side and just sit in the
world of possibility what could be possible for you if you actually took
consistent action and and built up this passive income
don't worry about how just think about the the water on what would your life be
like if you had 5 10 20 50 grand demand coming in for very little work and in
terms of risk
what's the risk of you not doing this
what's the risk of you living your life doing something that you settle for or
if you are doing what you love you're very lucky for that but what happens if
that changes so what's the risk if you're not taking action
the final thing I want to leave is it literally anyone can do this i'm not
special and I know a lot of other people that I know you've achieved the same
thing in their different fields
there's nothing special they've been lucky enough to come across this stuff
they read a book or rich dad poor dad with charge really recommend all of you
guys to do and they took some action if you want to learn more about that the
ways how to please check out my my blog which is just www Alex epitaxy . common
and sign up for that and I love you guys to think about designing a life that you
dream of
thank you very much for having me
