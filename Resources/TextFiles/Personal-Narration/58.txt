I professor my name is Alison Roy and this is my self and up three speech
it's called hickory dickory dock there are seven days in a week 52 weeks in a
year in 988 weeks in my 19 years of life how you plan your time has everything to
do with the outcome of your life
the time you spent your past help your present and the time you spend your
present will help you in your future
six years of my childhood was spent playing soccer and those six years with
the most memorable moments my childhood i still remember to this day the joint
putting on my cleats before a game brought me the drum rush i would get
from scoring a goal and also the bonds i created with my teammates soccer show we
had a let loose and have fun when you're a kid you worry about being cool and
fitting in and soccer just made me forget about all that nonsense but as
soon as those six years started
they ended in a new chapter of my life began once I got to high school I
retired my cleats and traded them in for a planner a plan represents how many
things i have going on right now in my life I go to college full time I have a
full-time job and I have a social life just like many other people my age but I
also chose a planner to represent my present because the planner allows you
to plan out your next move in the next five to six years are playing out for me
right now my main focus for that time period is to go to school and get my
masters and physical therapy
even though the next few years of my life all planned out my future is it and
i have no idea what the future holds for my education or from my interests
I can get my masters and physical therapy and then realize it's not what I
want to do with my life
or it may not even take that long for me to change my major
another thing is my boyfriend for four years may join the air force when he
graduates from MIT in two years now it's just an idea but it could become a
reality
I honestly don't like thinking about the future because of how uncertain it is
I want to know what's going on and I don't want it to be a surprise
I just have to think of it this way the decisions I make now will help me find
out what is going to happen later on in my
life how you plan your time has everything to do with the outcome of
your life
the time I spent playing soccer my pass help me create my moral value of doing
things for me and I don't always have to fit in the time I spend in my present
busting my butt working and going to school will hopefully make my future
brighter a woman by the name of Stacy charter one said life is all about
timing
the unreachable become reachable the unavailable become available
the unattainable attainable have the patience waited out
it's all about timing thank you i really hope you enjoyed it
