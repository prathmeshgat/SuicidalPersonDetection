yeah
so I was backstage for that last talk but did I end up coming on stage like
after the guy who cured cancer
that seems a little rig see if I keep up so I don't know if I've slides this work
ok so my name is Pablo so I work at the intellectual Ventures lab
Oh back this is my lab we basically bought one of every tool in the world
hired one of every kind of scientist and what we try to do is invent for some of
the bigger problems that humans have
right this is really important I'm only here to tell you not to make more fart
apps for the iPhone the world is trying this grand experiment every day of your
life right we are living in it
the experiment is can we keep more people alive every single day on just
one planet right
every day more people more additional planets
that's a big deal the things that we did before we're talking about the theme
here tradition or traditions as much as we need to honor them aren't gonna solve
the problems that we have we have to invent
so what you should all do is try to find some big problems to work on and i'm
going to show you some of the ones we work on this is a way of visualizing one
of the problems that we have we started fearing hey we should take on energy
people need more so this is a concept
someone else came up with called a cubic mile of oil is just a way of visualizing
how much energy the world you
so in the year 2000 the planet consumed about 1 cubic mile of oil
that's a lot you can see it fills thirteen thousand ships full of oil
today
we use three and a half cubic miles of oil every year right
that's a lot a lot a lot of oil next 20 years we need to be able to grow from
three and a half an additional one point eight cubic miles of oil every year to
power the planet nexus the oil not counting other stuff right
and this is this is if we stick with our current policies globally
so if we stick with the current policies making things more efficient it's only
one point eight cubic miles of additional oil if we do a really stellar
job and improve on that you only need an additional one point four cubic miles
right feeling hopeless yet i hope so
gas is going to get expensive oil and gas coils gonna be expensive
we're going to have to you know start using a little less of it over that time
between now and what we we say like 20 50 so we have to come up with
alternatives to replace four or five of those cubic miles with other stuff just
because it's not as well so digitalizing the problem is a way to help you get
started so we thought we should work on alternative energies all kinds of ways
besides oil to power stuff and you know there's a lot of cool things when those
are good one
windmills for example can replace one cubic mile of oil
if we take our largest windmills and we cover the entire middle of the united
states that gets you one and that you know those are flyover States so maybe
no one's going to mind
but what happens after we put all the windows up that weekend right there with
you don't want him here
you don't know yeah so what we gonna do well anyway I'll leave that to you
we figured okay well windmills aren't high energy density so this is a good
one
uranium as 1.8 million times the energy density of oil like that can is
equivalent to like you know a couple of tankers are actually a lot of tanker
right so we started looking at nuclear which historically you know in our
lifetime has been politically unpopular a few safety issues now and then so we
want to kind of revisit nuclear
it's got some problems - what we do today is we dig up uranium out of the
ground
we enrich it in the centrifuges which basically is because that uranium has
been sitting around for billions of years and it's not as energy rich as it
was so we have to enrich it in centrifuges and then what happens is we
take the rich stuff we put in our reactors or bombs and the rest of it we
put in stock piles and put in these stainless steel casks that's nuclear
waste and we stick it in stock piles on the surface of the earth like this
we just store it from now until kingdom come
right just save that stuff in case we need it well we know what to do with it
but that's nuclear waste
so a conventional reactor today's reactors literally burn . seven percent
of the energy that's in that uranium when we dig it up right
they're not very efficient we don't care because like i said it's 1.8 million
times the energy density oil
so we think of that as a kind of problem a lot of energy there that's not being
used so we design new type of nuclear reactor nuclear reactor powered by
nuclear waste
so in our reactor what we do is we take that fuel that's left over and you know
although all the waste from the stockpile we put in our reactor this is
Neutron bombardment you can ignore this if you want but what's happening is we
take that fuel will take that waste put in our reactor and we enrich it inside
the reactor and we burn it inside the reactor so in this design it's kind of
like a cigar
you light it up at one end and it burns from one end to the other
over in this design over 60 years so that leading wave and riches fuel the
second wave burns the fuel
there's no moving parts there's not a possibility of of having a critical mass
of fissionable material that can get out of control and meltdown right so we can
go back and design these things with knowledge that we didn't have when we
did it the first time 50 years ago our entire team working on that is like old
guys that we pulled out a retirement
they were like interns on the first generation of reactors or its young guys
who just got out of college is a nuclear might be cool
you know there's no one in the middle because we haven't been working on that
we probably should
so in our reactor what's happening is we burn all that fuel and we get a lot more
efficiency back
this is a stockpile in Kentucky 700
she's what did I say seven hundred thousand metric tons of depleted uranium
sitting on the surface of the earth and our reactors we can power the entire
planet including growth for hundreds of years using just the fuel that we have
sitting there
we need new ideas like this I hope you guys come up with some better ones that
we did remember these guys
the ninety-nine percent we're not getting our fair share
you know that BlackBerry's muscle arms is basically us right
ninety-nine percent know you guys have college education you're probably closer
to one percent but ignoring that doesn't matter you're in the top
fourteen percent globally if you're at the bottom in America right so I don't
hear you complaining that you're in the ninety nine percent you're in the top
fourteen percent globally so we should be inventing for the problems the world
has right we're really good at inventing for that tiny little red spot on the top
give me a faster iphone damn it you know thanks Qualcomm they're working on it
I i love this building i love Qualcomm is a company built for invention if you
got in this Lobby is one of my favorite place in the world
there's thousands of patents the first page of every patent this company has on
the wall you should check it out
I love that anyway so we're trying to take on some of these types of problems
this woman is loading vaccines into a styrofoam cooler to trick him across the
Sahara to inject kids with vaccines against no polio and things that the
kids are dying from Africa right
what happens is a lot of the vaccines fail at least twenty percent of them
fail before they get used to get used anyway because we don't have a way of
knowing that they failed they failed because they didn't stay cold
hundreds of thousands of deaths every year because of this problem
the way vaccines work twenty percent is almost equivalent to zero you got to get
pretty close to a hundred before your vaccinating population so we invented a
new type of a kind of super thermos this thing you stick vaccines in it
stick it in the sunshine in the Sahara with no external power come back six
months later and your vaccines will still be cold start from cooler is good
for like four hours right
so we've been deploying these things in Senegal just to test them and they last
for months even with vaccine with drills every day
so you could literally load this thing up at the factory
put it on a barge send it to Africa drive across the country
stick it in the bush and start vaccinating kids and never have to worry
about the power going out or worried about whether things are going cold
weather or they're not staying cold
another invention area we work on a little close to home for qualcomm i
might get kicked out for showing this
this is a antenna you may know it as a pipe organ but those are resonators in
each one resonates in a different frequency right
that's what's going on but that's kind of an analog old-school antenna we
replace pipe organs with these things
synthesizers don't have pipes anymore they don't have a resonator for every
frequency they synthesize it using a computer chip right
we synthesized every song you listened to now comes off of a tool like this
right
artificially manufactured by computers and it's better so those domes you see
on boats contain a steerable satellite dish so that we can talk to a
geostationary satellite up there to get internet two boats right
this is the predator drone the reason it has that bullfrog shape is because
there's a physically steerable dish in there so they can talk a satellite so
kids in Nevada can control it with a joystick what it right
so that's because to talk to the satellites you gotta aim your antenna
we don't actually have any other idea how we're going to a man antenna at a
satellite so it's mechanically gimbal this big and heavy and expensive a few
years back we started working on a new area and science called metamaterials
these are materials that don't exist in nature but sometimes you can make them
and they can do really cool stuff this case we made a tunable dielectric
so we made an antenna using meta materials is a flat panel but it can
electronically steer its beam with no moving parts we can stick that on the
roof of a car or a boat or a plane and it can track satellites you know the new
satellite networks the new satellites that are going up today
every one of them has more capacity than the entire network from yesterday right
we have a huge amount of internet wireless internet capacity in the new
satellite networks
no way to talk to them without putting a big dish on the ground steering it
this thing you duct tape it to the roof it finds a satellite tracks it so we can
use Elio satellites in geostationary satellites like 400 milliseconds away
really slow you don't even want to use those things
elio satellites only 25 milliseconds away their wisdom by any way we can get
gigabit wireless to everyone on the planet this way
that's a really important thing to do
I personally believe and you can you get to kick me out after this get people on
the internet they can solve their own problems right this right this is what
it look like
so last thing i want to talk about I don't know
I'm sure you guys have all seen 3d printers and they're the future and
stuff i'll be working on advancing 3d printer so I work on this one called
MakerBot but also work on new 3d printing technologies so i'm gonna tell
you about what I've been working on in every business in the world
we have used computers to collect data to analyze the data and make better
decisions right
we don't have any data about anything you ever ate your entire life in the
eighties I would say someday you'll have a computer in your car
people thought I was crazy it probably was but now you have 70 computers in
your car
all right someday you'll have a computer in your phone
now we obviously take that for granted now I'm saying someday computers will
make your food and I think that is really important
so imagine a machine like that with three buttons on it
what I yesterday what my friends like and I'm feeling lucky
you push one of those buttons and I've got toner cartridges of frozen or dried
and powdered food printhead puts down a pixel of food hydrated with a needle
zap it with a laser to cook it rinse and repeat for every pixel and I print you a
meal
all right but it's a meal customized for you and your voice your allergens and
dietary restrictions
maybe inject your pharmaceuticals
that's a really powerful thing we can correlate your diet to the health
effects apply photoshop filters to your diet so you got to get off
sodium you know well drop it by a couple milligrams a day you'll never feel it
happening right we can't do those things today right with the way you're eating
right now is like cavemen
it looks good eat it it will stay that way and it shouldn't stay that way
but the more important reason to do that is the way Americans e right now is
wildly and efficient you guys throughout about forty percent of the food before
you ever even eat it
that's what's going on in America every American grocery store throws out 2,000
pounds a week and expired food right before anyone buys it
so in a system like this
I've got you know shelf-stable all the nature of the nutrients all the flavor
and a toner cartridge stays there for years and I don't print any more food
than you're going to eat a generate no local waste
it's a way to start getting some efficiencies back that's important
because when you look at our global trends again
we've got population growth obviously gotta feed you know fifty percent more
people over the rest of our life time but right now what's happening is you
eat like Americans because you're Americans the rest of the world eats the
same thing every day
they want to eat like Americans right
they want more money and more variety in their diet and that's exactly what they
spend it on if they get an extra dollar before they buy an ipod they had more
meat more variety their diet you compound that with population growth we
don't act
you have a plan for how to feed everybody and so we need to find ways to
make it more efficient
we've done that every other industry with computers and so I'm suggesting
that you guys get on this start making robots to make me some food
all right that's all I had for you today I'm going to get offstage thanks so much
i will be hanging out all day and i hope that you find time to come hang out with
me and tell me why I'm wrong
