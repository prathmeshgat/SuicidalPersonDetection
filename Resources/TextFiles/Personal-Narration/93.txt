i would like to talk about the need for cardiac surgery for eight hundred
dollars
the need and how it can be done
I'm a cardiac surgeon by profession but I have a very interesting job my job is
putting price tag on human life
now you must be wondering what kind of job it is
every day I see about 60 to 80 patients in my clinic
most of them a little kids sitting on the mother's lap I examine the kid and I
tell the mother that your baby has a hole in the heart
he needs an operation she has only one question
you know what that question is how much it is going to cost
I tell light is going to cost eighty thousand rupees which she doesn't have
and that is a price tag on the kid's life she comes up with 80,000 rupees
I can save the child if he doesn't have 80,000 rupees she's going to lose the
kid
this is what we doctors do from morning delivering putting price tag on human
life
how long you will accept it to go on
Indians are genetically three times more vulnerable for heart attack
we develop heart attack at a younger age
the average age of my patients in England was 65 in india it is 45 in my
practice it is not the young son bringing his old father for a heart
operation
it is all father bringing his young son for a bypass grafting we need to do two
million heart operation CEO
can anybody guess how many heart surgeries are done
it's only about 120,000 heart certainly see what happens to the remaining 1.9
million people they finish gradually over a period of time in the process
with perhaps produce the largest number of young widows in the world how long he
will

kept it to carry on why this mess
this message because our government spends about 1.1 percent of the gdp on
healthcare slightly more than sub-saharan African countries we thought
we have to look at alternative way of funding health care
so around 10 years ago we convince the state government government of karnataka
to launch a health insurance called yes Vinny we convince 1.7 million farmers to
contribute 50 rupees per month
eleven cents Parliament and government agree to become the reinsurer in 10
years or one of four and a half black farmers had varieties of surgeries and
60,000 farmers had a heart operation
all because of the power of 5 rupees per moment
yeah
now we are trying to convince or policymakers we have 850 million mobile
phone subscribers who are spending our 150 rupees per month just to speak on
the mobile form
so if we can collect 20 rupees from each mobile phone subscriber we can cover the
health care of 850 million people
this is that where people in isolation of every week but together they are very
very strong when this kind of a massive transformation happens when everyone has
a health care you need to change the way the hospitals are built so 20 years ago
we started a concept of hell city in bangalore and this is a picture of our
banker hell city
the plan was to have five thousand beds in one campus with the infrastructure to
see about ten to twelve thousand outpatients by day the first building is
a heart hospital which is the infrastructure to do 60 heart operations
in a single day but we have 100 times in india with the population of half a
million 2 1,000,000 they can't afford to have this big help
city they need a small super specialty hospital so we worked with the LNT to
build a 300-bed super specialty hospital and a group it build up with 46 million
dollars
this is about twenty percent of what it costs otherwise and we wanted
lnt to build it in six months and sure enough they built the hospital
yeah
this hospital has come up in mysore in this hospital after the heart surgery is
done when the patient is in the ward patient is not taken care by the nurses
alone
patient is scared by the spouse traditionally spas are the family member
has normal to play in the patient care
a typical heart patient on the first today is ready to go home
family that was not involved with the care on the fifth day we called the wife
you are one plastic bag filled with medicines and Teller ask her to take
care of the husband
she's lost she doesn't know what to do with him whereas if is in world with the
entire process of caring in the hospital so we worked with the University of
Stanford University and develop the audio video based curriculum to train
the spouse to be the caregiver
so that that is the continued to be of the care when the patient goes home
the economy of the 21st century will be drawn by health sector because health
sector is one industry which can create millions of jobs you look at the IT
industry with just a lot of support from the government for one quarter of a
million dollar turn over night industry they create about seven to ten jobs in
healthcare industry to get a quarter of a million dollar turnover we need to
hire 250 people and majority of the people in health sector of unskilled
people we hired a very small number of extremely skilled semi skilled people if
you want to stable society if you want a better future
we need to create jobs for rural women as an organization we have over 13,000
employees across the country and at one point of time over ninety percent of
four employees where women white women
if i had the job of leading the floor in the hospital
I can give the job to the man and Game six thousand rupees salary and he will
spend three thousand rupees on himself
and three thousand rupees goes to the family's welfare
he said I did the job to his wife and give us six thousand rupee salad
she will spend the entire six thousand rupees on the family's welfare a woman
who comes from a lower socioeconomic starter one she's employed she becomes
the empower women and these empowered women will disappear in the children and
when these children they grow up they build a great nation
this is the power of job creation for the women
the next big thing in healthcare is going to happen in India the next big
thing and health care is not going to be a magic pill or a faster scanner or a
new operation it is going to be utilizing IT to make the hospital safer
for the patient's believe in hospitals are not safe for the patients getting
admitted to an American Hospital which is one of these surface some of the
safest hospitals on the earth getting admitted to american hospital today is
10 times the riskier than skydiving
we need to make it safer to make it safe for we have to use IT
so we are investing heavily on ipad based solution
replacing the chart with the ipad which will follow the patients and we are
investing heavily in developing simulators to turn the critical care
nurses to be better critical care nurses if we can train a pilot to fly f-16
fighter plane with the simulator we can easily use a similar to train the
critical care nurses and this is what we are trying to do
- for all this to happen the cost has to come down costs of health care has to go
down if the solution is not affordable it is not a solution
so we invested heavily on technology to get the information we have advanced
Oracle ERP solution on a cloud we are hospitals in twenty two locations every
day by twelve o'clock in the afternoon
all the doctors all the senior administrators get the SMS on their
mobile phone with yesterday's revenue yesterday's expense and the orbital
margin for us
looking at the profit and loss account at the end of the month of the hospital
is like reading a post mortem report
well as having the profit and loss account on a daily basis is a diagnostic
tool which will help you to reduce of cost
this is why our organization's profile at the Harvard Business School as one of
the case studies and occupied the front page of wall street journal for years
ago
we believe that India will become the first country in the world to dissociate
health care from affluence in the oil prove to the world that the wealth of
the nation has nothing to do with the quality of health care its citizens can
enjoy
why we can do it when I when other developed countries can can do it
it's mainly because we produce the largest number of doctors nurses and
medical technicians in the world
also the US we have one of the largest number of us fda problogger
manufacturing units we have everything going for a phenomenal healthcare
delivery but never give the code to the policymakers who you think made it
happen
everything good in this country happens by default and if there is one country
which is guided to manage my god that is my country
thank you
