i must confess i feel a little bit like little miss sunshine
after all these wonderful presentations I'm standing here on this empty stage I
have no slides no music no power . and i'm sitting here with my cards with a
speech I didn't memorize but in any case i really hope to inspire you to reflect
more on the important role that art has to play in society and to do so without
images which is something very very difficult for someone on my vocation
all art is quite useless wrote Oscar Wilde in his preface the picture of
dorian gray
it goes without saying that his ball more are always quite tongue in cheek
but what I want to draw your attention to here is the word quite it indicates
that declaring art as utterly useless with a step too far even for wild how to
better explain then that art is something of an unnecessary necessity
imagine for a moment a world without art and culture without music without cinema
without dance opera literature poetry that world would be a very very dull
place devoid of imagination
the one thing that distinguishes us as human beings from other species without
art the finality of reality would be intolerable or to paraphrase nature
we have art in order not to perish from the truth
what I want to talk about today is the role of contemporary art in society
why is that important and i'm not talking here about the one percent of
the art world
the handful of artists selling for millions of dollars two billion
billionaire oligarchs which is a very tiny minority of what constitutes the
art world but about the art that is engaged with society at large and
engaging also with the key issues
that affect us all today because that is the art that matters
today more and more artists are inspired by reality then by the formal properties
of that reality as we know them colors shapes beauty in today's complex world
I believe that art for art's sake is insufficient
it is the importance of another kind of art that i would like to talk about and
this is what we call socially and politically engaged art artists working
in this realm the realm of the socio-political use different media to
express themselves from traditional media like sculpture and painting to
film video performance and installation to deal with key questions such as
democracy civil and human rights capitalism the economy migration and
mobility the environment and the commons and a whole host of such issues they
strive to provide a counterpoint to the prevailing images of power and also to
the stereotypes that are fed to us by the media since the time of the
Enlightenment art has a very long history of engagement with the political
art is in a sense political as it is about a person's views and freedom to
act freedom to express themselves so art is always about taking a position there
have been moments in history where art was put to the service of politics and
society in a program in which the gap between the two was temporarily bridged
one can immediately think of example of the Russian of on guard
but this effect has been always very hard to pinpoint and to quantify and
times have changed so that
what does our do what can it do
and why is it important the fact of the matter is that it is very very difficult
to pigeonhole and categorize what exactly art is and how it functions that
is its beauty and that is its ungraspable value for want of a better
word
it is impossible
both quantify and qualify how r affect those who see it because it works in
mysterious latent and very subtle ways
that's why it's always such an uphill struggle to convince politicians of arts
funding to convince them that the value that is the importance the significance
and the merit of art cannot be judged by popular consensus and numbers alone and
this is because art allows for something that cannot be defined
therefore one can never predict the ways in which it will affect people change
people's minds or influence their subsequent behavior as such it's a
subtle power that changes the world one perception at a time and that is why art
is very often seen and rightly so as a threat
by the powers that be the british artist antony gormley began by defining art as
follows
art is about one person's expectation of and their use of their own freedom to
act
art is optimistic because it makes a person it makes a statement that one
person can change the world
even if that world exists on a tiny piece of paper 5 by 7 inches art as an
act of shared communication is in a small way saying I make the world
I don't simply inherited in making this world
what does not do then art can change the way we think it can crack open cemented
opinions and it challenges the given it looks at the world with a critical eye
it opens up horizons beyond those which are familiar to us
it challenges standardized or problematic views of the world
it exposes that which is often hidden under the carpet it reaches further than
be accepted and the known and beyond the inevitability that we have been told we
cannot escape heart functions as the conscience of society
the best art should ask you what you think
prompt you to ask questions and put you into doubt
r testifies to the power of the human imagination
the unique capacity of humans to project to dream and to reflect on things not
only as they are but as they could or should be in a world driven by popular
consensus including for example the homogenisation of globalization and the
general dominance of conservative values art advocates difference and gives voice
to the other with a capital o it highlights important ideas problems and
issues that are sidelined or silence due to political or economic interests art
functions as the barometer of society as a moral and intellectual resistance and
as a friend of mine
the South African artists candle dear says art shake the tree and then all the
monkeys fall out our doesn't change the world on a macro level it changes the
world on a micro level in that sense its importance cannot be measured art
changes things in very subtle ways it is a swarm of soft power artists themselves
are a kind of free-floating intelligence independently operating untied
individuals who are free of the normative thinking of their environment
and are able to act independently of social class realities
art can foster dialogue reconciliation engagement solidarity connectivity and
understanding of those with opposing views
I'm convinced that if more people engage with it
the world would be a much better place in that sense
art should also have a much more important place in school curriculums
and education artistic imagination and creativity are not added bonuses for
society
they're not the icing on the cake they are integral to the human spirit and to
human aspirations an essential part of what makes us human heart thinks about
the world in it
current state and it can reimagine the world as it should be
more importantly art is the last frontier of unregulated free expression
which is particularly important at a time when the commons public space and
information are increasingly being privatized and regulated by the
neoliberal order in that sense
art is born of and advocates freedom is always see a world full of opportunities
chances potential possibilities and prospects their ability to go beyond the
possible and into the imaginable should be an example and an inspiration for us
all
and as I started with Oscar Wilde
I'd also like to finish with him no great artist sees things as they really
are
if he did he would cease to be an artist
open your eyes to art and surprise yourself
