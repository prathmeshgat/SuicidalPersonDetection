I think it is every successful person you know has failed at what they love to do before %HESITATION 
I've been unsuccessful on in my career al used in know about it because I wasn't famous yet I was trying to be famous I was trying to get a record deal for six years and I kept getting %HESITATION turned down and any successful person you know even though it seems like everything just happened for them %HESITATION a usually was preceded by a bunch of failure %HESITATION are the significant amount but the great ones are the ones that don't fail the they're the ones that learn from that failure and they keep going in the persistent tenacious

and for me that means that even when you hear no you have to keep going to all those knows until you get a yes 
and with learning something new I think 
it's the same principle when I was younger I didn't really know that you can just get better at things because I think we're so used to the idea that you're talented at something and 
and %HESITATION 
it's sort of fixed you know the idea that 
%HESITATION he's just a good singer

as I've gotten older I wasn't singing away that was sustainable and %HESITATION I wasn't breathing right I was doing a bunch of things correctly I realize that there was a ceiling %HESITATION that I couldn't crack through unless I actually %HESITATION studied and worked under a coach to get better and %HESITATION this idea that things are just fixed %HESITATION 
is proven not to be the case you can get better at things you can grow and even people that are innately talented still need to go beyond %HESITATION that basic talent that they have and and cultivated
