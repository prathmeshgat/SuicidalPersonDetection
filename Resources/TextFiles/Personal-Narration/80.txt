but - where's that fight on behalf of american families
I need you there still have some fighting you two
you know the folks at the top of this country
turns out they don't need another champion of Washington
they'll always have a seat at the table now always have access and influence the
people who need a champion for the Americans whose letters i read late at
night after a long day in the office
the men and women are needed on the campaign trail every day I laid off
furniture workers retraining at the age of 55 for a new career at a community
college eat
she needs a champion the restaurant owner who needs a loan to expand
it's got great food but the bank turned him down he needs help he needs a
champion
the cooks and the waiters in cleaning staff working overtime and a hotel in
the morning or vegas trying to saving up to buy our first home or send their kids
to college they need to champion the auto worker who who was laid off . the
plant would never reopen and is now back on the job filled with pride and dignity
building a great car building America
he needs a champion the teacher in an overcrowded classroom with outdated
schoolbooks digging into her own pocket to buy school supplies not always
feeling like she's got the support she needs but showing up every day because
she knows that this might be the day that she's got a breakthrough and she
makes a difference in one child's life
she needs a champion
all those kids in inner cities small farm towns gets dreaming of becoming
scientists doctors engineers are entrepreneurs diplomats or even a
president
they need a champion in Washington because the future will never has many
lobbyists is the status quo children don't have lobbyists the way
all companies are banks do but it's the dreams of those children that will be
our saving grace
that's what we fight for that's why I need your Iowa to make sure their voices
are heard to make sure your voices are heard and that's why we've come too far
to turn back now
we've come too far to let our hearts grow faint now is the time to keep
pushing forward to educate all our kids and train all our workers and to create
new jobs and rebuild our roads and bring back our troops and care for our
veterans and brought an opportunity and growing middle class and restore
democracy and make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or
how you started out what you look like
who you love
what's your last name is here in America you can make it if you try
that's what we're fighting for and i love after all the months of campaigning
after all the rallies after the millions of dollars of ands it all comes down to
you
it's out of my hands now it's in yours
all of it depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow
it's just a remarkable thing the way our democracy works and it and at a certain
point all this effort and all these campaign rallies and then it just comes
down to each of us as citizens all of it depends on you bringing your friend or
neighbor your co-workers your mom your dad your wife your husband to the polls
that's how our democracy is supposed to be the single most powerful force in our
democracy is you moving this country forward begins with you
