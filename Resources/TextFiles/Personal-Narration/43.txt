so I have a facebook friend whose life seems perfect
she lives in a gorgeous house she's a really rewarding career and she and her
family go on all these exciting adventures together on the weekends and
I swear that they must take a professional photographer along with
them because no matter where they go or what they do the whole family just looks
beautiful and she's always posting about how blessed she is and how grateful she
is for the life that she has and I get the feeling she's not just saying those
things for the sake of facebook but she truly means it
how many of you have a friend kind of like that and how many of you kind of
don't like that person sometimes we all do this right
it's hard not to do but that way of thinking costs something that's what I
want to talk to you about today is what our bad habits cost us
maybe you scroll through your Facebook feed and you think so what if I roll my
eyes
it's just five seconds of my time how could it be hurting me
well researchers have found the end being your friends on Facebook actually
leads to depression
that's just one of the traps that our minds concept for us
have you ever complained about your boss or looked at your friends lives and
thought why did they have all the lock can't help thinking that way right that
way of thinking seems small in the moment
in fact it might even make you feel better in the moment but that way of
thinking is eating away at your mental strength
there's three kinds of destructive beliefs that make us less effective and
rob us of our mental strength
the first one is unhealthy beliefs about ourselves we tend to feel sorry for
ourselves
and while it's okay to be sad when something bad happens
self-pity goes beyond that it's when you start to magnify your misfortune
when you think things like why do these things always have to happen to me I
shouldn't have to deal with it that way of thinking keeps you stuck keeps you
focused on the problem keeps you from perfect from finding a solution and even
when you can't create a solution you can always take steps to make your life or
somebody else's life better
but you can't do that when you're busy hosting your own pity party
the second type of destructive belief that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs
about others
we think that other people can control us and we give away our power but as
adults who live in a free country
there's very few things in life that you have to do so when you say I have to
work late
you give away your power yeah maybe there'll be consequences if you don't
work late but it's still a choice or when you say my mother-in-law drives me
crazy
you give away your power maybe she's not the nicest person on earth but it's up
to you how you respond to her because you're in control
the third type of unhealthy believe that holds us back is unhealthy beliefs about
the world we tend to think that the world owes us something we think if i
put in enough hard work than I deserve success but expecting success to fall
into your lap like some sort of cosmic reward will only lead to disappointment
but I know it's hard to give up our bad mental habits
it's hard to get rid of those unhealthy beliefs that we've carried around with
us for so long but you can't afford not to give them up because sooner or later
you're going to hit a time in your life where you need all the mental strength
that you can muster
when I was 23 years old
I thought I had life all figured out
i graduated from grad school I landed my first big job as a therapist
I got married and I even bought a house and I thought this is going to be great
i've got this incredible jumpstart on success
what could go wrong that all changed for me one day when I got a phone call from
my sister she said that her mother was found unresponsive and she's been taken
to the hospital
my husband Lincoln and I jumped in the car and rushed to the hospital
we couldn't imagine what could be wrong my mother is only 51 should have any
history part of any kind of health problems when we got to the hospital
doctors explained she had a brain aneurysm and within 24 hours
my mother used to wake up in the morning saying the great day to be alive passed
away that news was devastating to me
my mother and I have been very close as a therapist and you want to intellectual
level
how to go through grief but knowing it and doing it can be two very different
things took a long time before I felt like I was really healing and then on
the three-year anniversary of my mother's death
some friends called and invited Lincoln me to a basketball game
coincidentally it was being played at the same auditorium bread last seen my
mother on the night before she passed away I hadn't been back there since i
wasn't sure I wanted to go back but Lincoln and I talked about it and
ultimately we said maybe that'll be a good way to honor her memory
so we went to the game we actually had a really good time with our friends on the
drive home that night we talked about how great it was to finally be able to
go back to that place and remember my mother with a smile
rather than all those feelings of sadness but shortly after we got home
that night
Lincoln said he didn't feel well a few minutes later he collapsed
how to go for an ambulance his family met me at the emergency room
we waited for what seemed like forever
so finally a doctor came out but rather than taking us out back to see Lincoln
he took us back to a private room SAT us down and explained to us that Lincoln
was the most adventurous person I'd ever met was gone
we didn't know at the time but he had a heart attack
it was only 26 he didn't have any history of heart problems
so now I found myself a 26 year old widow and I didn't have my mom
how am I gonna get through this and to describe that as a painful . in my life
feels like an understatement
and it was during that time that I realized when you're really going
through tough times good habits aren't enough only takes one or two small
habits to really hold you back
I worked as hard as i could not just to create good habits in my life but to get
rid of those small habits matter how small they might seem throughout it all
held out hope that someday life could get better and eventually it did you use
down the road i met Steve and we fell in love and I got remarried
we sold the house that Lincoln and I had lived in and we bought a new house in a
new area and I got a new job but almost as quickly as I breathe a sigh of relief
over that fresh start that I had
we got the news that Steve's dad had terminal cancer and I started to think
why do these things always have to keep happening
why do I have to keep losing all my loved ones this isn't fair but if I've
learned anything it was that that way of thinking would hold me back
I knew what I was going to need as much mental strength as I could muster to get
through one more loss
so I sat down and I wrote a list of all the things mentally strong people don't
do and I read over that list it was a reminder of all of those bad habits that
I've done at one time or another that would keep me stuck and I kept reading
that list over and over and I really needed it because we made a few weeks of
writing it
Steve's dad passed away my journey taught me that the secret to being
mentally strong that you have to give up your bad mental habits mental strength
is a lot like physical strength if you wanted to be physically strong
you need to go to the gym and lift weights but if you really wanted to see
results
you also have to give up eating junk food mental strength is the same if you
want to be mentally strong
you need good habits like practicing gratitude
you also have to give up bad habits like presenting somebody else's success no
matter how often that happens it will hold you back
so how do you train your brain to think differently
how do you give up those bad mental habits that you've carried around with
you
it starts by countering those unhealthy believes that i talked about with
healthier ones for example unhealthy beliefs about ourselves
mostly come about because we are uncomfortable with our feelings feeling
sad or hurt or angry or scared
those things are all uncomfortable we go to great lengths to avoid that
discomfort
we try to escape it by doing things like hosting a pity party
and although that's a temporary distraction and just prolongs the pain
the only way to get through uncomfortable emotions only way to get
deal with them is that you have to go through them to let yourself feel sad
and then move on to gain confidence in your ability to deal with that
discomfort unhealthy beliefs about others come about
because we compare ourselves to other people
we think that they're either above us or below us and we think that they can
control how we feel that we can control how they behave or we blame them for
holding us back
but really it's our own choices that do that you have to accept that you're your
own person and other people are separate from you
the only person you should compare yourself to as the person that you were
yesterday and unhealthy beliefs about the world come about because deep down
we want the world to be fair we know want to think that if we put in enough
good deeds enough good things will happen to us or we toughed it out
through enough bad times will get some sort of reward but ultimately you have
to accept that life isn't fair
and that can be liberating that means you won't necessarily be rewarded for
your goodness
but it also means no matter how much you've suffered you're not doomed to
keep suffering
the world doesn't work that way your world is what you make it
but of course before you can change your world
you have to believe that you can change it I once worked with this man who had
been diabetic for years is doctor referred him to therapy because he had
some bad mental habits that are starting to affect his physical health
his mother had died from complications of diabetes at a young age
so we just believed he was doomed he'd given up trying to manage his blood
sugar all together
in fact his blood sugar had gotten so high lately that was starting to affect
his vision and he had his driver's license taken away and his world was
shrinking when he came into my office it was clear he knew all the things he
could do to manage his blood sugar
he just didn't think it was worth the effort but eventually he agreed to make
one small change
he said I'll give up my two liter and a pepsi have it and i'll trade it in for a
diet pepsi
and he couldn't believe how quickly his numbers started to improve and even
though he came in for a week to remind me how horrible diet pepsi tasted
he stuck with it and once he started to see a little bit of improvement he's
well maybe I could look at some of my other habits
he said I could trade in my nightly bowl of ice cream first snack with a little
sugar and then one day he was at a thrift store with some friends and I
found this beat-up old exercise bike
he bought it for a couple of books and he brought home and he parked in front
of his TV and he started to pedal while we watch some of his favorite shows
every night and not only did he lose weight but one day he noticed he could
see the TV
just a little bit more clearly than he had before and suddenly it occurred to
him
maybe the damage done to his eyesight wasn't permanent
so we set a new goal for himself to get his driver's license back
and from that day forward he was on fire by the end of our time together he was
coming in every week saying okay what are we going to do this week because he
finally believed that he could change his world and that he had the mental
strength to change it and he could give up his bad mental habits and it all
started which is one small step
so i invite you to consider what bad mental habits are holding you back
well unhealthy beliefs are keeping you from being as mentally strong as you
could be
and what's one small step that you could take today right here right now
thank you
