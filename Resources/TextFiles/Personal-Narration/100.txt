you may have noticed by now that I'm really fat and that's okay
you wouldn't be the first back in nineteen ninety seven when I was in
seventh grade I heard a question posed about me in the locker room of my middle
school
i SAT hidden in a bathroom stall hunched over
not wanting to give myself away when I heard a girl asked when was the last
time Whitney saw 90210 up
I was like more of a Saved by the Bell girl myself and I actually never seen an
episode of 90210 so i clenched my muscles and held my pee and waited with
bated breath for the answer
and when it came when she stepped on the scale
the girls are wrapped into laughter and I felt the familiar sting of
embarrassment seeping into my cheeks
it took me back to my fifth grade here on the soccer field where the boys had
taken to singing a song about me called baby Beluga that ended with she's got a
whale of a tale
you might be picturing now how fat I probably was
it's easy to conjure up a mental image of an awkward girl spilling out of her
shorts running up and down the sidelines like hey I'm open
but if you have that mental image you would be wrong because in 1995 when i
was ten years old I looked like this and when I look at that picture now my heart
aches because when i was just becoming aware that i had a body and that other
people have opinions about my body
I became a statistic like eight out of ten 10 year olds who today are afraid of
being fat
ten-year-olds that's a real statistic i bought the lie that diet culture sold me
when I was ten years old that told me if I am thin thinner than enough then i
will be happy but at ten years old I felt the furthest thing from happy and
so the emotion I most connected with my body with shame after that shame
following me like a shadow and after the 90210 incident
I knew I had to take action so I grabbed the handle of my father's toothbrush and
shoved it down my throat until I vomited and thus began my nearly lifelong battle
with eating disorders
I continue to excel in school to play sports to dance
shame and i won lots of awards and trophies sometimes shame was like a
really overbearing adult begging for a piggyback ride and other time shame
trailer a few feet behind me dragging its leash like a faithful dog never
leaving my sight
by the time I was 18 years old in 2002 and becoming a young woman
shane has solidified itself as my most faithful friend it accompanied me to
every dance performance to every soccer tournament it was even there in the
bathroom with me at my prom as I hunched over a toilet and threw up my dinner
just minutes before being crowned prom princess when I moved to college that
fall I brought shame along into my dorm room and I noticed that my body was
changing
by the time I went home for Christmas break I gained 50 pounds and I'm
thinking like okay I'm an overachiever so clearly the freshman 15 is just not
enough i was getting mysterious bruises all over my body and I was like why am I
bumping into door reason furniture
when do I get so clumsy but then I realized I wasn't clumsy
my body was expanding so quickly that I had lost all kinesthetic awareness of it
my body literally didn't know how to fit in its physical space anymore and
similarly I didn't know where I fit in the world to say that my weight gain was
difficult would be an understatement
by the time the second semester was finished i gained nearly a hundred
pounds and there was the sympathy from like the pretty girls who asked me if
I'd like ever had a boyfriend and then there was that one frat boy who had
taken me on a dinner date in August
granted it was to ruby tuesday but it was a dinner date
and when he saw me in March he looked right through me like I didn't even
exist
it was like I'd been forced into some social experiment against my will to put
on a fat suit and parade about in public
the differences in the way that people treated average Whitney and fat Whitney
were striking suddenly I was assumed to be lazy desperate sloppy stupid and with
every single pound that I gained my self-worth continue to shrink further
and further so I became a different person after that I quit my dance
classes
I failed a lot of my academic classes and in a world where it felt like being
a fat woman was the biggest taboo
I didn't have anyone to talk to sure there were times where I pulled myself
up by the bootstraps and I said I'm gonna go to the gym or I'm going to
venture out to this party but there was always a whisper a dirty look and insult
to remind me why I didn't deserve to be in those spaces so I would come back
home to my apartment to the only friend that had never deserted me
shame we would stay up late into the night commiserating getting drunk - no
more pain
I'd order takeout for us both and do anything to avoid going out in a world
that didn't want me
and of course all the things that I had done to cope only compounded the problem
and i continued gaining weight in 2005 highway 280 pounds and my nurse
practitioner swiveled her stool from in between my legs in the stirrups checking
her chart and announcing a little too cheerfully that she thought i had PCOS
what the hell my mind started reeling
because i did not remember learning about this STD in my seventh-grade sex
I'd class but the more I learned as I poured over the brochures and the
pamphlets and PCOS wasn't an STD
it was a syndrome a grouping of symptoms with no cure that affects one out of
every ten women in America and is the leading cause of infertility and then
like putting together a puzzle other stuff started to make sense
the handfuls of hair that had come out in the shower the coarse dark hairs all
over my face my period that had visited me only
twice when I was 15 and never again and of course my sudden and severe weight
gain my freshman year of college I didn't have an explanation for it then
but I had an explanation for it now
I was insulin resistant so would life with PCOS make it impossible to lose
weight
absolutely not would it be even harder
absolutely yes and for a woman who wanted anything but to be fat this felt
like a death sentence and then I got pissed off
I wondered why have I never heard of this thing i wanted to know why I always
been dismissed when I went to the doctors told that I was young and
irregular or I was drinking or I was on Prozac
but out of all those emotions that I felt the one I felt the most of what a
shame
so after college I packed two suitcases my clothes and shame and i set off for
Korea to teach english i got promotion after promotion and i traveled the world
shame and I made it all the way to the top of the Great Wall of China
we ate sushi together in Tokyo we vacationed in Malaysia and Vietnam we
even sunbathe in Bali
but all of these experiences that shape it's so wonderful were tinged with that
disgusting and city a shame that sucked the life and the color out of my
memories and left me nothing but black and white and a never-ending wish to be
thin so that i could really start my life now living abroad wasn't all bad i
had some of the best experiences there but the discrimination I faced with so
much more overt than anything I had at home
I got laughed at pointed out and called the pig every single day in the street
in the store in the nightclub
I'll never forget the first time I got in a taxi and the driver started at me
for every mile until we reached our destination
then there was the guy that swerved his bicycle dangerously close to where i was
walking on the street
stop pedaling looked at me said Pig and then spit
I chased him which was a futile effort especially because he was in a bike and
I her hold every Korean insult that I could remember until I saw him vanish
and
the dark and then I headed back to my apartment to cry but it wasn't until I
was assaulted in a bar a man raised up behind me to start punching me in the
back of the head that I realized
hold up I don't deserve this
it took such an aggressive abusive action to join me in to the realization
that I was a fat human but I was human and i told myself I'm going to go back
home to the states and i'm going to prevent this from ever happening to me
again I'm going to lose weight so i moved back home in 2011 in 2011
hi Wade 329 pounds and I lost a hundred pounds in eight months I worked out for
12 to 15 hours every week
I count my calories I obsessed and I hit my shame for my personal trainer and
from my family and for my friends even from strangers who said you're
remarkable
this is the hardest thing that anybody could ever do and look at you doing it
I've never been more proud of you since the day you were born
pretty soon I was eating five hundred to a thousand calories a day and I was
throwing up everything I ate on Friday which was my cheat day and my eating
disorder had returned in full force
one day I walked out of the gym having just run a few miles on the treadmill
and a car drove by slowly and lowered the windows and they yelled at me that
ass when I climbed into my own car dripping with sweat
what happened next was nothing short of a nervous breakdown I had literally been
working my ass off to do the one thing that everybody told me would fix it
the one thing that everybody told me would make me worthy but that guy in the
parking lot didn't care he didn't know who why where I was or what I had done
to change and I fantasize about losing the rest of my hundred pounds and
thinking about my goal
wait but that all I could see was sagging breasts and loose skin and crows
feet around my eyes and I knew intellectually that as long as I let my
self-worth be determined in the eyes of others
I would never be content but i could not disengage from the belief that i had to
be thin to be happy and so in that moment all of my hope was extinguished
I had grown tired of the calorie counting of the weight loss of the
obsession with everything food and exercise
I wanted something more to live for so naturally i got a job in radio where i
had to wake up at four in the morning every day for minimum wage and like the
vast majority of people who lose a substantial amount of weight in their
life
I started to gain it back and within a year and a half I was the heaviest
weight I'd ever been I was 350 pounds and in the deepest place of depression
I'd ever known
I didn't have any money to pay my own rent so I moved back in with my parents
and my 29th birthday i found myself sobbing in my mother's lap lamenting
about the dismal direction of both my professional and personal life and I
asked her mom how can anything ever change and my mother produced dependent
and on it were the words
something good is going to happen but in my misery I was hyper-focused on one
detail and one detail only when so i started to re-evaluate my life i thought
back to when I was ten years old and 90 pounds and now I'm almost 30 and over
300 and it hasn't mattered
I've never been happy I never loved myself I always carry the weight of
shame
so I decided to try an experiment and I made a promise I said whitney if there
is something that you get asked to do and your only reason for declining is to
say because I'm fat
then you are going to do that thing anyway the universe was listening
because you better believe three days later I got a message from a local
photographer who told me
you want to take some boudoir photographs of me for free
I wrote back to her immediately sister
I would never in a million years take my clothes off in front of a camera
so when should i meet you
a bottle of wine and a designated driver later I got an unexpected result when I
looked at this picture for the first time in my entire life
I didn't dissect every flaw I didn't cringe and in fact i thought i was
beautiful
so I decided to keep the experiment going
my co-workers at the radio station we're trying to ask me to do a dance video and
call it a fat girl dancing and put it on youtube and at first my reaction was
absolutely not
because no one has seen me dance since I was 18 fat girls don't get to do that
and i'm still balking at the word fat and I had to ask myself with me of
anyone on the planet
don't you know that being fat isn't synonymous with worthless lazy stupid
undeserving
I wasn't sure that I knew but I wanted to find out if I did so I said yes and I
posted this video on to the internet and a few days later I started getting a lot
of phone calls but they weren't the normal phone calls like for my dad asked
me if I toilet paper and stuff
it was like Steve Harvey and CNN good morning america and the Today Show and
they all told me they wanted me to come on their programs talk about my dance
video and explain this new lifestyle this new body positive lifestyle that I
was leading and I couldn't understand like what is so special or subversive
about a fat woman dancing but I went on the shows and I did my little dance and
then the letters started coming in
I got an email from a boy a teenage boy in Lebanon and he said whitney it's
illegal to be gay here and I'm gay but when i watch your videos
I feel like my life is going to be okay
and I said okay and then after that some more letters started pouring and this
one was from TLC and they asked me if I would consider doing a reality show and
I mold it over and talk about all the ways that could like ruin my life and my
reputation and all the ways it still might
but then I thought about that boy in Lebanon and for every other person who
would never turn on a TV and seen someone who looked like them who
struggled like them
and so I said yes it wasn't before long that even more letters started pouring
in and many of them were from fat women but just as many of them weren't i was
talking to little girls anorexic women people with different abilities
grandfather's that it always hated their noses and then I realize like it's not
about the fact that I'm fat
it's about the fact that i am living a shame free life in spite of a society
that tells me I don't deserve to
we all have something that society tells us we should feel shame about for me
it's visible in a world where thinness is championed above all else where we
tell women in no uncertain terms if you are not young enough in enough and
pretty enough
you're indisposed your disposable living in that world deciding to love my body
had become a radical act and doing what I love in that body had become powerful
and then became the inevitable questions from everybody
how is this doable and I never used to know how to answer this question because
I didn't know how to tell someone to be like me but now I think I know how to
tell people to be more like them
we think that we have to magically have confidence before we do something but
this is backwards
confidence is a product of action not the other way around if I had to wait to
have the confidence I never get out of bed to do anything
I had to do the hard stuff in my case posing half naked and dancing and then
the confidence came as a reward and the confidence came as a building block
but living authentically shame free is not sunshine and roses every day on the
internet and in my real life i'm told that i am disgusting delusional and I
should probably hurry up and have that heart attack i'm bound to have some the
world will be rid of me but living shame free has also brought more joy into my
life and I ever could believe existed
it is connected me with millions of people I would have never met
face-to-face and injected the color and happiness back into my life and I often
think of one of my favorite quotes from my favorite feminist audre Lorde
she said I am deliberate and afraid of nothing and then I think back to this
picture 1989 five years old before my first dance recital this little girl was
deliberate and afraid of nothing serving up all the face and sass in the world
completely unapologetic about what she knew she was put on this earth to do and
I think we get discouraged because we've all been that little girl but then the
world beats and breaks us down
we think that being confident being happy should be as easy as putting on a
light switch right
just do it just be happy just love yourself
but it isn't that easy and I know that it's not like a light switch living
authentically free of shame is more like stumbling toward a motion sensor light
in the dark
you have to advance forward to a target that you can't see but trust that you
ultimately get there and the universe is funny because the only thing that will
turn that light on is your movement and your action and if you live this way if
you know that every time you're stumbling and spinning and scrambling
you are actually doing the hard part you are actually doing the work even if you
can't pinpoint your progress
if you make a commitment to live a shame free life and know that it's an
undertaking that you have to do every single day day in and day out and you
are deliberate about choosing that life you will find yourself illuminated and
if you're like me
it'll probably be when you least expect it thank you
