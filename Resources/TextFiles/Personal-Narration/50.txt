 yeah
ok
ever since I remember I look up to the stars
you know one fact fascinated me the most that all the atoms in our body came from
the stars that exploded and the moment of the explosion all the elements that
were created in the heart of the star spread across space ending up created
stars and planets
these elements are everything you see around you including ourselves
i'm going to start with a short story
I lived in London on for 15 years of my life
just after my studies in the UK back in the nineties was working at virgin
I came up with a business idea so I pitch that to my manager he said no go
sit down
so what about him I went to his manager so I try again
he said no again so i went even above him so i ended up locking doors at the
highest level within the Virgin Group and eventually I was sent to page at the
house
richard branson's house at holland park
so with the legs shaking at the age of 27
I went there and tried my lack of finish my presentation and i was asked how much
do you want
so I took it the breast and i mumbled the high seven-figure amount that i had
in mind
and he said no i'll give you double
so that moment I became founder and CTO of virgin business
the company was launched 1999 with richard branson's own as an one stop
shop for small businesses to get online at a time when the internet was still
somewhat exotic we helped thousands of businesses discovered the web as a
marketplace so we found ourselves at the height of the dot-com era amongst the
likes of amazon google ebay being listed as heroes of the era have been played an
important role in transforming the young version of the internet into what we
know today
three years later the company was sold with a major return doesn't so tired of
times the original investment and that story transform my life and bind set a
click
but if you truly believe in yourself you must persist and one day you will
succeed
who have fought back in the nineties that we will have the internet so
integral in our lives
the internet revolution has happened and today we cannot imagine life without the
internet fast forward to today a new upcoming revolution is space and it will
come into our lives the same way the internet it and Here I am today
after 15 years home applying my strengths and experiences from my lab
from my years 15 years in london in founding CEO with one vision to set a
high goal
that one's inspire and galvanize our talented people into areas previously
unattainable for Cyprus once again driven with the same persistence that
define my past
we said to prove first to ourselves what we can achieve on an island where the
notion of space research was outrageous
we started by inspiring the younger generation towards building a brighter
future and the result started to arrive in May to learn 14 our research team are
sense was invited to present their research paper at spaceships the
foremost space research summit in the world
that's making cyprus one of 21 countries with research at this high level after
their presentation
our team was approached by the organizers and asset to the team
tomorrow dress markley and see that the front and so they did
their paper was short listed in the world's top for student research papers
what happened next when we return back to Cyprus you can imagine and this set
an example and the next year
another team are cannot be at this time wins the best mission concept of
international nasa space apps challenge with robotic astronauts assistant for
the international space station so we are off in two weeks time from today
invited by NASA to go to Cape Canaveral to meet with them
but this talk is not a story about the past but I story about the future
people always ask me why space
why waste our money up there and then we got enough problems to solve down here
and I smile
space exploration is not an end to itself by reaching out to space we bring
solutions to everyday life solutions all around us providing myriads of benefits
to our quality of life here on earth but above all cheering humanity's first for
discoveries we are born as explorers
it's in our DNA that's what separates us from other Apes we envision and we go
and do if all those explorers and adventurers were held back with everyday
problems we will still back we will still be in the case from our answer
stores colonizing the insured world
- christopher columbus and beyond
humanity has always been pushing for the next frontier
so what's coming next
Mars the red planet over 50 missions were sent to Mars since nineteen sixty
in the next few years we will see the beginnings of a more space in the first
humans on Mars extending with green houses ending too slowly create a
self-sustaining colony on Mars in the safety of an artificial protective
environment but the ultimate goal is to transform Mars releasing oxygen and
turning its atmosphere into more like Earth from humans first setting foot in
the next 10 to 20 years on Mars many many years in the future into an
earth-like planets on Mars to turn masse from this to this
terraforming mass , red planet step by step into a blue world in essence a
second earth because of our species is to survive
expand outwards into space we must
there is one again in all space agencies have their eyes set on Mars getting
there though
requires humanity transforming our technologies here on earth
once again space exploration will be bringing technologies but here
home meanwhile here at home
space is increasingly been commercialized the world's first space
port open for years ago at new mexico and in the next few years paying
tourists can enjoy right into space
experiencing the great lessness of zero g and over six hundred and forty people
have already reserved their tickets for tourism into space
the next step look into the space hotel
but of companies have already started planning hotels in space with
experiences like this expanding into larger commercial space facilities with
regular flights from Earth and down all their hybrid space planes like the lab
cart which is even bigger than the airbus a380 could soon reduce the
journey of London to Sydney a down to a mere three and a half hours looking
deeper in the future
a futuristic and technological daring project a space elevator with a base
rooted on two heirs and extending all the way into orbit
connecting earth with a space base that could one day far into the future look
like this and how about the moon
we haven't been to the moon since the seventies it will once again become a
center of attention man will set foot on the moon again most likely sooner that
we will set foot on Mars the world space agencies are already talking about moon
bases and more villages in the foreseeable future
another goal for the next couple of decades is to divert and grab a steroids
in order to harvest at their precious minerals turning asteroids into mining
facilities where space cruisers can be built with these materials and the star
cruisers could propel humanity even deeper into space
onwards to the nearest stars into the far far future but i'm leaving for last
a big question that always puzzled humanity
are we alone in the universe
Europa is one of Jupiter's largest moons
it's covered with a nice layer of a hundred kilometers speak it slightly
smaller than our Moon
with temperatures as low as - 220 degrees Celsius but under the thick
layer of ice that's a massive ocean of liquid water that holds three times as
much water as all the oceans on our planet Earth
it is the nearest and most likely place where where we may find alien life
nearest since I was a child I was dreaming of the time of that day that
europe i could be explored the first mission to Europa has been announced it
is aimed to launch in the next decade and i am thrilled to announce that CSCO
will be part of this mission
yeah
and make sure that may find Ellen life in the universe for the first time on
serving humanity centuries all question are we alone in the universe
how do we not be to Venus we wouldn't have known about airs on problem and
solve it as we did
how do we not going to space we wouldn't have solar panels that help down here
towards a sustainable green future space will continue to feed our hunger literal
and metaphorical new food sources new challenges feeling our never-ending meet
for knowledge
no matter how far it seems no matter which country you're in
how small how big we started we are in here in Cyprus with a population of less
than 1 million we can order those who said space
why in our determination got us through the doorstep of NASA and the forefront
of space exploration
we are already living the dream with successes exceeding our wildest
expectations
listen to the stars when you look up to the skies
the cosmos looks the same no matter where you are whether your apartment
spreading this message to your children whether you're a researcher joining the
research a business
embracing your technologies the organization has breached the vastness
of space down to the level where the individual has the opportunity to
participate in space activities globally in space programs from all over the
world from the simplest outreach to education entrepreneurship research and
development all the way to active participation in actual space missions
bring out the Explorer in you discover how you too can be part of the future
today I invite you to join me in this quest and all together we can change the
world as we know it
everybody has a place in space
yeah
yeah
yeah
see you out there
thank you
yeah
ok
yeah
