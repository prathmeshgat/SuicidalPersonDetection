organizers last year got like the CEO of JPMorgan and the police commissioner and
this year they got a massive goofballs in me
however now that I'm here I'm going to tell you about the world most
interesting education story
cool before I start I want to play a game
alright what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you through a bunch of
seemingly random indian celebrities and I want you to tell me what all of them
have in common
can we do this man can be super let's do it
this young and I must admit extremely charming bollywood actors this veteran
politician this acclaimed economist and this emerging young cricketer anyone
Oh lovely he's right there all engineering education cool right
in fact let me share with you some fascinating inside ever since our
independence in 1947 we produce zero noble arts and science the US has a
hundred plus 26 Olympic medals that said just 26 Olympic medals and China produce
hundred in the 2008 games alone however however there is something we produce
more than the US and China combined anyone's guess I'd number of Engineers
how Who am I and why and how do i know some look he's laughing he's an engineer
themselves so hook
Who am I and why in how do i know so much about the story so so i spent my
initials of growing in Saudi Arabia light and then my parents back about the
bomb menu of better education and in school I made two big mistakes you want
to know what those mistakes are ya
ok so the first mistake of my life was that I was good at studies
ok the second mistake of my life was i was particularly good at math no income
when you commit these two mistakes you end up committing a third mistake buddy
for which is
you get into engine he was exactly what I did
how are in engineering life I kind of realized early on it wasn't quite my
thing right so I founded this t-shirt startup in case you can't recognize me
that that mean with all the board so I found this piece has started to vent my
frustration and for which I was listed as one of the desktop student
entrepreneurs later on I moved to the city of Bangalore where I spent a solid
two years essentially selling child
no here's the thing about banglore alright bangalore is full of Engineers
ok and they are not just engineers that engineers frustrated with their lives
no it's not funny so one in every two NTID employees in bangalore contemplate
suicide at some point of his life
crazy right now of what happened next is I quit my job because I was curious like
how did such a diverse country like ours get so obsessed with one thing producing
engineers and look like nobody before we tried answering so I quit my job and
then something magical happen some 300 people across the globe contributed
14,000 are still in dollars in a record-setting crowdfunding campaign to
help me the goofball compiler book
ok so the next two years i found out about a lot of interesting people places
and events that helped shaped what I call one of investigators of sessions
how it's going to be difficult for me to take you through like two years of
research in a couple of minutes right so what I'm going to do is going to take
you through some of these people some of these places and some of these events
okay are you ready can we start ok so the first person i'm going to tell you
about is this very very interesting character who goes by the name Thomas
Babington Macaulay Macaulay was a bond genius he had an estimated $OPERAND IQ
over like 180 to 190 he had the tremendous ability to learn any language
within a fortnight
ok so the bricks told him dude like you know India is one of our newer colonies
and one of our more importantly why don't you go there and you know he'll
figure a few things for us he said India there is no way I'm going to india so
then the bridge said dude can you please do this for us so make only didn't have
a lot of friends
okay and he was really attached to his sisters so he pleaded with a certain
Hannah in the handle these guys want me to go to India can you please come i
don't want to go alone so Hannah said and I quote I see India only as a
country of filth and disease so this is what the president next they said okay
fine we'll give you 10,000 pounds which in today's time translate to half a
million pound your face it if somebody gave me half a billion pound right now
I'd be willing to go to North Korea hit so so this guy are forcibly got his
sister to India and he roughly spent four years in India did not bother
learning a single Indian language went back to the written Parliament okay and
on second of every 1835 made a very moment the speech which i'm not going to
quote entirely but i'm just going to pick up one line which kind of
summarizes the spirit of the entire speech McCauley said and the code we
need to teach in english if we do not teach them English they are going to
waste their youth touching a cow's as this is what he said and Tara that's how
english education came to India now what does English education have to do with
the life of India's engineers great couple of things one of vast majority of
India's engineers actually unemployed you know by anyone from the industry
they probably know why what was lacking the most anyone lovely
yeah close enough work to didn't call it that they called poor communication
skills right for communication skills in the window for you know poor english and
come on english is international language and it's an acquired language
so English became a class and I didn't just become a language
secondly this very important idea evolution to which so many of Indian
engineers or lives to and also first foreign trip to happen in india and not
in China you know why because of our familiarity with English just because we
were acquainted with English could be you know able to quote easily and also
talked to our clients in europe and america
hooray no not to mention America let's discuss the Indian engineers tremendous
success story in the US tech industry so beat this right to all the biggest take
giants in the world today run by engineers and you know they actually all
their life to a very specific moment in history that moment is actually a
specific as this photo October 1957 728 p.m. ok so what happened on fourth of
$MONTH october 1957 720m is the Soviets launched the first human satellite in
space the Sputnik and the u.s. lots of lost its mind you know the US and Russia
always had this Indian student I / have been like two indian students right
always want to better than each other so hope so the Americans a large demanded
do you wanna do something man
so the change their enter immigration policy and they invited the best of
scientists the best doctor and the best of engineers from across the globe know
engineers back in India were pretty bringing our mother still previous a and
they were frustrated with India socialist regime back then because it
didn't allow them to do much the government control practically
everything so they had two options
ok one wants to go with our best friends forever BFF as they say these days BFF
Russia or to go to America the tomb we don't have the best of relations at
least back then but what happened was something curious most engineers did
their best friends Russia and all went to most of the men to America instead
anyone tell me why anyone know my collie English because we were comfortable
speaking English like the Americans did all of them moved to America and rest is
history right
the earliest bunch of Engineers went to America did extremely well not just for
themselves but also for America and then pave the way forward future engineers to
come from India so much so that kids these days actually take up engineering
so that they can go to the US that's the easiest to get to the US right
in fact you won't believe this and I'm not exaggerating
ok there
communities in south india the communities in south india that educate
the Suns in engineering send them to the US just so that they can come on hydari
because us return has a lot of command supposedly in their community a lot of
duty right now moving from the US coming back to India and to my favorite
three-letter work the IITs how you know if you're thinking i'm not going to
bother you know introducing the idea is to you but what I want to tell you
instead is how a medic an American news broadcaster once introduced the idea is
to it
you know viewers in America and listen to this carefully okay listen very
carefully
it said and I'm quoting we import all from Saudi Arabia cars from Japan
television from Korea and whiskey from Scotland
so what do we import from India we import people some really really smart
people and all these people seem to share a common credential they are all
graduates of the indian institute of technology or the I eighties as they're
known how when us compare something to I you know it has to be valuable tips and
in fact it's not just valuable to them valuable to our society to the extent
that once this affluent woman in delhi accompanied by her equally affluent
father to curse unto the den director of iit delhi speaker and requesting for an
admission of course so now the father got slightly embarrassed so he left the
room the father left the room and then the director saw this kids the report
card he said I'm sorry ma'am i can get your get into the eyeties however i can
get him into the Imperial College of London which eventually did you know
what's fascinating about the story the characters in world does anyone want to
take a guess as to who the characters are I'll tell you
indira gandhi on dinero and rajiv gandhi the most powerful family in the country
can we
denied admission into the eyeties know where I'm coming from is uh what
happened gradually that you know in a society that weeks of corruption in
everyday life the ideas became one of those very few meritorious institutions
for the Indian middle-class you know for the social upliftment that is one second
what also happens for the longest time the I eighties were essentially ideas
other engineering colleges but essentially the only institute which
offer quality education of any kind right so eventually you know they're in
the middle class decided to stay put their kids into the ideas or take other
engineering courses now if something Bollywood has taught me
ok is that every great obsession has an equally fascinating cheese beer women or
ba engineering so my journey took me to a lot of these places of which i will
tell you about 22 very interesting places the first one is the city of
Hyderabad but these images that you see from one of the student hostels and
managed to get their access to tell you why there because these kids are
disconnected absolutely disconnected from the outside world I'm not kidding
if the aliens were to invade us right now they would be the last people to
know guys and girls aren't allowed to talk to each other they suspended the
court talking right the sole purpose of their life is to study and get through a
good engineering college in fact you won't believe this
and it's you know the funniest part is whatever i'm saying is on funny and
that's the funniest part this guy left all his belongings and ran for his life
out of the campus
nobody knows very well nobody knows what he teaches the landlord of this madness
seriously no from of Hydra but let's go up north to this interesting city called
con food
ok no in town pooed there is this small locality that's called coaching Wendy
because there are so many coaching classes this the locals call it putting
money he can so then I got talking to a local panel and I said of you know can
you tell me do
regions of this place and history and how did it start we don't think this old
professor who started coaching kids into engineering colleges and gradually
everyone followed and it became like a big business
cool but LM can't break na you know see the old man he said and I quote so what
opening game come order okay and you people more and more to guys like one of
those things right that that keep happening in fact not just that it's
this place is actually a you know a hard part for gang wars between coaching
professors who shoot each other data auto rivalry right this kidnapping to
them dead but this isn't really the sort of that that worries me the most
let me tell you what does know this young girl could you know like most
teenagers have had her share of man crushes listen to her whatever music
could have been part of the audience they are seeing this video later on
youtube but the sad part is she's no more right and she's no more only
because she didn't want to become an engineer and she's entirely alone
india has one of the highest you to side rates in the world 20 kids kill
themselves every day mostly due to academic pressure in the gardens by the
time I talk is over some kids somewhere must try you know killing himself for
killing herself crazy society 11 right anyway let's get out of this bloom and
actually one of the more relatable illustrations from the book so you see a
young boy called morning after all who back in $MONTH 2003 goes to his parents
and tell them tell them their mom that you have a fantastic idea i want to
create something called the social network and i think it's going to be in
the world obviously in parents think that he's possessed probably by a
go-getter haven't done getting meningococcal engineering college and
today I'm on the curveball is probably Oh mid-level IT manager contemplating
suicide in bangla but you know every story has a villain know every story has
a village I was trying to find out the big
villain of my story and I sort for really long and guess where I found it
right behind me with the cute and innocent little face you know what that
is a school
no Indian schools no matter how you look at it is easily the biggest human
resource tragedy in the world i can show you but the biggest tragedy actually
lies in its design right now if you look at it how do schools come into being
no schools are actually more than 400 years old so the Empire 400 years ago
basically needed three kinds of people right they needed close to manage their
territories military guys to protect their territories and they needed
factory workers because industrial revolution has started and what are the
kind of skill set that these factory workers are these three kinds of people
require no creativity that requires consent no creativity
listen to instructions right so it is actually no coincidence that our school
the model on the factory like exactly how factories model right right from if
i can give you another right on the thinking of the bell right in the
factories to symbolize that you know it's lunch
you can go get our factory and going into food to the grouping of kids it's
based on the age and not the learning ability test and the point of a test is
not to assess your kids strength and weakness but to actually certify mass ok
or feel just like in factories know it's clear if we don't really fix the school
india has a larger story based in the world and if you don't fix the schools
of these kids are going to look the same boring dull and uninspiring right now
unless we fix our schools in India you will always become an engineer first and
then decide what to do with your life and with all the chaos tragedy dead
blood the life of India's engineers will continue to remain the world's most
interesting educational story
thank you so much
