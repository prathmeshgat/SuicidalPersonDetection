I'm all 
honored to be with you today for your commencement 
truth be told 
I never graduated from college 
and now 
closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation 
today I want to tell you three stories from my life 
that's it 
no big deal 
the first story 
it's about connecting the dots 
I dropped out of re college after the first six months but then stayed around is a drop in for another eighteen months or so before I really quick 
so why do I drop out 
it started before I was born 
my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student 
decided to put me up for adoption 
I felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates 
so everything was all set 
for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife 
except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really want a girl 
so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking 
we've got an unexpected baby boy you want him 
they said 
course 
my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college 
and my father had never graduated from high school 
she refused to sign the final adoption papers 
she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college 
this was the start 
in my life 
and seventeen years later I did go to college 
but I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford 
and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition 
after six months I couldn't see the value in it 
I have no idea what I wanted to do with my life 
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out 
and here I was spending all the money my parents and save their entire life 
so I decided to drop out and trust that it will all work out okay 
it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made 
the minute I dropped out 
I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me 
and begin dropping in on the ones that look far more interesting 
it wasn't all romantic 
I did have a dorm room so I slept on the floor in friends rooms 
I returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with 
and I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night 
to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna temple 
I loved it 
and much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity intuition turned out to be priceless later on 
let me give you one example 
read college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country 
throughout the campus 
every poster every label on every drawer 
beautifully hand telegraphed 
because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes 
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this 
I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces 
about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations 
about what makes a great typography great 
it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture 
and I found it fascinating 
none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life 
ten years later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer it all came back to me 
and we designed it all into the mac 
it was the first computer with beautiful typography 
if I had never dropped in on that single course in college 
the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts 
and since windows just copy the mac 
it's likely that no personal computer would have the 
if I had never dropped out I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do 
of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college 
but it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later 
again 
can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards 
so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future 
you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever 
because believing that the dots will connect down the road 
give you the confidence to follow your heart 
even when it leads you off the well worn path 
and that will make all the difference 
my second story 
is about love and loss 
I was lucky 
I found what I love to do early in life 
wasn't I started apple in my parents garage when I was twenty 
we worked hard in in ten years appliqu roan for just the two of us in a garage 
into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees 
we just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned thirty 
and then I got fired 
how can you get fired from a company you started 
well 
as apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me 
and for the first year so things went well 
but then her visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out 
when we did our board of directors sided with him 
and so a thirty I was out 
and very publicly out 
what have been the focus of my entire adult life was gone 
and it was devastating 
I really didn't know what to do for a few months 
I felt that I'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down 
that I drop the baton as it was being passed to me 
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce 
and tried to apologize for spring up so badly 
I was a very public failure and I even thought about running away from the valley 
it's something slowly began to dawn on me 
I still loved what I did 
the turn of events that apple is not change that one bit 
I've been rejected but I was still in love 
and so I decided to start over 
I didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could ever happen to me 
the heaviness of being successful 
was replaced by the lightness 
of being a beginner again less sure about everything 
freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life 
during the next five years I started a company name next 
another company name Pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife 
Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film Toy Story 
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world 
in a remarkable turn of events 
apple bought next and I return to apple in the technology we developed next is at the heart of apple's current renaissance 
and the reason I 
have a wonderful family together 
I'm pretty sure none of this would've happened if I hadn't been fired from apple 
it was awful tasting medicine but I guess the patient needed it 
sometimes life sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick 
don't lose faith 
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did 
got to find what you love 
and that is true for work as it is for your lovers 
your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is 
do what you believe is great work 
and the only way to do great work is to love what you do 
if you haven't found it yet keep looking 
and don't settle 
as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it 
and like any great relationship it just gets better and better 
as the years roll on 
so keep looking 
don't settle 
my third story 
it's about death 
when I was seventeen I read a quote that went something like 
if you live each day as if it was your last 
someday you'll most certainly be right 
it made an impression on me 
and since then for the past thirty three years I've looked in the mirror every morning and ask myself 
today were the last day of my life what I want to do what I am about to do today 
and whenever the answer's been no for too many days in a row I know I need to change something 
remembering that all be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life 
because almost everything 
all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure 
these things just fall away in the face of death 
leaving only what is truly important 
remembering that you are going to die 
the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose 
you are already naked 
there is no reason not to follow your heart 
about a year ago 
I was diagnosed with cancer 
I have a scanner at seven thirty in the morning and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas 
I didn't even know what a pancreas was 
the doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months 
my doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order 
which is doctors code for prepare to die 
it means to try and tell your kids everything 
you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them 
a few months 
it means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that will be as easy as possible for your family 
it means to say your goodbyes 
I live with that diagnosis all day 
later that evening I had a biopsy 
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat through my stomach into my intestines 
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor 
I was sedated but my wife who was there 
told me that when they view the cells under a microscope 
the doctor started crying 
because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is treatable with surgery 
I had the surgery 
thankfully I'm fine now 
this was the closest I've been to facing death 
and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades 
having lived through it 
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concepts 
no one wants to die 
even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there 
and yet 
death is the destination we all share 
no one has ever escaped 
and that is as it should be 
because death 
it's very likely the single best invention of life 
it's life's change agent 
clears out the old to make way for the new 
right now the new is you 
someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away 
sorry to be so dramatic 
but it's quite true 
your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life 
don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking 
don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice 
and most important 
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition 
they somehow already know what you truly want to become 
everything else 
secondary 
when I was young 
there was an amazing publication called the whole earth catalogue 
which was one of the bibles of my generation 
it was created by a fellow named Stewart brand's not far from here in Menlo Park 
and he brought it to life with his poetic touch 
this was in the late sixties before personal computers and desktop publishing 
so it was all made with typewriters scissors and Polaroid cameras 
sort of like Google in paperback form thirty five years before Google came along 
it was idealistic overflowing with ni tools and great notions 
Stuart and his team put out several issues of the whole earth catalogue 
and then when it had run its course 
they put out a final issue 
it was the mid nineteen seventies 
and I was your age 
on the back cover of their final issue 
photograph of an early morning country road 
kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on 
if you were so adventurous 
beneath it were the words 
stay hungry 
stay foolish 
was their farewell message as they signed off 
stay hungry 
stay foolish 
and I've always wished that for myself 
and now 
as you graduate to begin a new 
I wish that 
for you 
stay hungry 
stay foolish 
thank you all very much
