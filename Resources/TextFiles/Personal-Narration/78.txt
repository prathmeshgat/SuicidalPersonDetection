hello everybody
I want you to do something with me really quick
I want you to all think in your head remember the time because i know every
single one of you need in here have done this when you're procrastinating doing
homework and you're procrastinating by listening to music on youtube
now you know when you're looking at youtube and you are watching a video
there's related videos on the right hand side of the screen
I want you to imagine that you're listening to some random song and you
see a little picture on the right hand side that looks pretty familiar
so you click on it and what you see is something that will change your entire
life
imagine if you clicked on the video and you realize that somebody posted a video
of you and labeled it the world's ugliest woman or man thanks for a second
how do you feel how do you think somebody would feel if they found that
i'll tell you because it happened to me and the moment I found this video I was
. i was given two options
I could either choose happiness or i could choose to give up now being in
this situation isn't something that's new to be because i was born with a very
very rare syndrome
there's only three people including myself that we know of that happen
syndrome
I'm 24 years old
I've never paid over 60 to balance my entire life
I literally could eat whatever I want whenever I want
knocking hate now it might sound pretty amazing
it is from just look to be honest
but I am so small and I look very different from other people
so as you can imagine when people see me and they've never heard my story they
don't know who I am they know nothing about me
they see me and they think what's wrong with that girl like eating disorder does
she have
why she's so skinny from the second I was born the doctors prepare my parents
to expect
absolutely nothing out of me
they said I wouldn't come out crying they said I would never talk i would
never walk i would never crawl
I would literally accomplish nothing in my life and my parents said you know
what we're going to take her home
we're going to love her and we're going to raise her as best as we can
so that's exactly what they did they raised me completely
normally I was a cute kid I'm not gonna lie I was so small that my parents have
to go to toys r us the Barbie doll clothes because regular baby clothes
were way too big on me
if you go like this that's the size i was when i was a baby
I personally don't remember but that's my parents will p
I grew up completely normally so normally to the point that when i
started kindergarten
I had no clue that I was different I couldn't physically see that I look
different from the other kids
I unfortunately had to find out in a way that I like to think of as a big slap of
reality
45 year old i'm sure you guys know the feeling
the night before the first day of school and you're super excited
you have that like anxious feeling in your stomach because you don't know
who's going to be in your class and going to make friends
that's what i felt i had my little kind of lunch box the matching bow ruffled
Sox ready to go
I walked in on the first day and I saw a little girl reading a book
I locked up to her and I smiled at her and she looked up at me like I was the
scariest thing she'd ever seen
and my first thought was that she's rude
I'm a fun kid she's missing up
so I let it go and the rest of the day unfortunately didn't get any better
no one wanted to play with me no one wants to stand by me no one wanted to
have a single thing to do with me because I was different
and again I couldn't understand because I was raised so normally until going to
the playground was hard
I remember climbing up to the top of the playscape wanting to go down the side
but there's a long line and as soon as I got there everybody moved and you would
think yeah
VIP to the slides but they were moving because they were scared of me
so that's when I had to go home and ask my parents what's wrong with me
why doesn't anyone like me I'm just like them and my parents encouraged me to go
back to school be myself and eventually they'll see that I'm just like them
and that's exactly what I did so again at such a young age I was forced to be
in this situation of I could either choose to be happy
or i could choose to give up luckily i chose to be happy as I grew up I started
making a lot of friends i I'm pretty funny so I missed a lot of friends
really easily and once i started making friends my friends started becoming my
bodyguards per se
when people would come up to me and kind of tease me and make fun of me which
happens often they will come up and say this is my friend Lizzie you know nicer
pretty cool
and luckily it worked as i got older i of course had to deal with a lot of
bowling
luckily no physical bullying but a lot of name-calling its tears and so I felt
self-conscious a lot even though I was so young because I didn't look like the
popular girls but I again continue to be myself
the middle school I did cheerleading I was a flyer he could have seen held high
and went over there
I'd realized that I was a people person I love being around people i love
talking to people meeting new people so I just get every organization that I
could think of high school cheerleading your books top newspaper theater I hate
acting
I want an award in the play I was doing all of these things and once I got to
high school I was at a very high . and I felt really good about myself until the
day I found the youtube video
this video's eight seconds LOM it had no sound
it had over four million views so this one video that was eight seconds LOM i
scroll down and there were thousands of comments on it
telling me I should kill myself if people see my face they would go blind
so I thought those people how could they don't know me they'll absolutely nothing
about me
so again I was put in the position choosing happiness or to choose to give
up and in that moment I didn't want those people to define who I was as a
person I wanted to tell them off
I did but I told myself with it you're going to prove to these people that
they're not going to win and they're not going to hold you down
so at this point I'm deciding how i can get my revenge
what am I going to do I'm a very goal-oriented person so I decided to set
four goals for myself i decided i was going to be a motivational speaker
I was going to write a book I was going to graduate college and I was going to
have my own family in my career I made these goals when I was probably software
beginning of junior year 2013 will be by eight year of motivational speaking
yeah
yeah
I told myself I wanted to write a book I never thought I'd be like on harry
potter toilet level but i knew i wanted to write a book
my first year of college I published my first book called Lizzie beautiful in
English and Spanish
I never thought it would happen but i ended up writing my second book and she
came out this past October healthy beautiful be you a couple days ago I got
an email from my publishing house with the release date for my third book
i told myself i wanted to graduate college and this may i will be getting
my degree from Texas State University my fourth goal is to have my own family my
own career the family part down the line
I'm only 24 the career part I feel like I've gotten a good jump on it and so now
I'm faced with what's next
what am I going to do one of the biggest motivations for me to accomplish all
those things was that youtube video every time I was sad every time I
doubted myself
you may think that sounds kind of crazy and you're thinking why I would go back
to that video and i will look at every comment every hateful comment and he was
fuel to my fire to keep going
every nasty comment made me want to work even harder even harder
it's kind of funny timing because my mom said well your goals are pretty much
gonna be all done what are you gonna do now are you going to take a rest
I said no are you kidding don't waste my time
my next goals are going to be even bigger but that bad video was finally
taken down so I thought great things are looking up life is pretty good
this pass on their as i was preparing for this speech I started getting a lot
of Twitter notifications and when that happens my heart sinks because I never
know if it's something bad
unfortunately it was something that somebody else posted another that video
of me
this person had over a million subscribers his channel
he had to google my name in this video i have horrifying music playing on the
search came up and all of his subscribers started googling me and
sending me really hateful things
my dad's always told us you could have your one good cry and then you have to
pick your chin up smile and move on to the positive i had my one good cry
i smiled and I said what great accomplishment is this video go to lead
to
I told myself busy you're going to show these people that they're not going to
define you
I'm not going to let the people who stare at me that people call me ugly
the doctors who said I would never accomplish a thing
they're not going to find me that they're not going to define me and
they're not gonna win
I kind of look at this whole battle of the world's ugliest woman vs me and I
realized the best revenge is with your accomplishments
so yes i won
thank you
yeah
yeah
