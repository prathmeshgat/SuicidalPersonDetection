yeah
yeah
if we could go out away from the city lights to a dark sky in a remote
location on a moonless night and look up we would see untold number of stars each
star in the sky is a son and if our son has planets Mercury Venus Earth Mars etc
it seems natural to think that other stars should have planets also and they
do astronomers have found that each star in our sky has at least one planet
so the next time you're out in a dark sky and look up you can start wondering
about the planets around that those other stars other sons
we have identified thousands of planets around other stars
hundreds of them are about the size of Earth and dozens of them are expected to
have surface temperatures that are not too hot not too cold but just right for
life
i'm here to tell you about how I and others are going to be searching for
signs of life around these distant planets far away orbiting other stars
now we're not searching for radio signals concocted by some kind of
intelligent little green people far away
we're actually looking for a very very very subtle signal like a whiff of smoke
that could be very hard to detect at all
and also very hard to interpret i'll start with earth earth is the only
planet we know of that has life on it in our solar system and in the entire
universe and we start with a thought experiment could we detect life on earth
from afar given instruments that we commonly used to study planets and
and other astronomical objects the answer is yes and carl sagan had a
brilliant control experiment in 1990 when the Galileo spacecraft was on its
way to Jupiter it swung by earth for a gravity assist and he had the
instruments turned on to look at Earth from far away and he had his team do
like a blind study pretending they knew nothing about earth could they infer the
presence of life on Earth and what they found were three things that were
strongly suggestive of of life on Earth and actually they chose their wording
very carefully as am i
they didn't say oh we've absolutely found it was strongly suggestive those
three things were number one
abundant gaseous oxygen in the atmosphere we as humans breathe oxygen
in our atmosphere is filled to twenty percent volume by oxygen but actually
you know what
without life on earth without plants and photosynthetic bacteria we would have
virtually no oxygen number two they saw a widespread surface pigment that
corresponded to no known molecule or mineral
number three they observed abundant methane in the atmosphere which in the
presence of oxygen is in extreme thermodynamics equilibrium and with
these three things they concluded that there is strong evidence for life on
Earth here are some images from that experiment
basically what they're saying is that if you find a bunch of things that don't
belong and you work hard to rule out every other possibility you may actually
be left with this suggestion of finding life and that's what I and others are
aiming to do for planets far away around other stars
so let's zoom away from Earth past the planets in our solar system
pass the human-made spacecraft to a distance of about a thousand light years
now this is actually real map of real stars and the highlighted ones are stars
with known planets
we know of thousands of exoplanets around other stars and so the question
now is could we spot
could we infer the presence of life on Earth if we could have space telescope
and look at a star far away and and block out the starlight and see the
planet directly and we are actually trying to build complicated space
telescopes we are building them we plan to launch them to do so
so the question is could we see life from very far away
and the answer is yes for an earth twin and in fact we even know what it was
earth would look like from that far away would look like this
this is a real image of earth not from a thousand light years away but actually
from four billion miles away as taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft some years ago
can you see earth believe it or not that is Earth
it's just amazing it's a little tiny pale blue dot
this here is light that is scattered in the in the camera the red band is like
that is scattered in the camera optics but there's a pale blue dot
I hope some of you are wondering how how on earth could we find life that just
from that little pale blue dot and in fact the reason
earth is blue in this image it's not because of the oceans which actually a
very dark and reflected light
it's because the same reason our sky is blue it's a light scattering off with
small particles just make it's blue and it's actually called Rayleigh scattering
so we would do is we would need to analyze the light in more detail and let
me explain that by this picture of a rainbow and here you see this light of
the Sun is split up into many colors by refraction in a raindrop
now if we could look at the rainbow more detail in great detail
we'd see some parts of the rainbow or missing Knothole colors but just you
know thin lines would be missing and those are from gases in the Sun and in
the Earth's atmosphere and here is a solar spectrum
that's a term for the sun's light split up in two colors and now you can clearly
see the parts of the so called rainbow that are missing and these are our gases
that are in the sun's atmosphere that have I like to say taking bites out of
the spectrum they prevented some of the light from reaching the detector in the
instrument that made this mission
because of the gases just absorb light and so here you can see if we could do a
class on this and analyze the spectrum and learn all about
you'd have to learn some quantum mechanics and about atoms and other
things we could actually analyze this and find out what is in the sun's
photosphere
we're not gonna do that now instead we're going to go to earth spectrum and
here i'm showing you a an image of her spectrum you can see at the bottom of a
colored rainbow along the bottom and then you see a squiggly line we
sometimes refer to this as squiggly line science but what it is is you can see I
want you to just see how some of the lines in the solar spectrum they're very
deep
they're very very dark perfectly dark that would correspond to a deep part
here
some of them are more narrow so there'd be a narrow line like this you know some
you can see the shaded at the edges and that's why it's sloped here now if the
earth had no gases in the atmosphere this reflected light spectrum would be a
straight line
ok instead it has has various gases and i'm not going to go through it all of
them are but this cartoon does highlight a few of the interesting ones
it has i'm just not repeating myself but it has oxygen is this line here
abundant gaseous oxygen that is made by life on Earth that has this special here
it's referred to as a vegetation jump a special pigment it's not
chlorophyll but it's kind of related that on plants on earth have a very
strong rise in red in reflectivity
we also have a methane atmospheric nothing here and other things also water
vapor are the most of the big features in the earth spectrum are from water
vapor and know that actually is is because water vapors are very strong a
greenhouse gases highly interactive with radiation and actually all life on earth
requires liquid water and so when we look at another for another earth and
when we were able to look at spectra of other planets we like to see water vapor
in the atmosphere as a sign of of surface liquid water so that's your twin
and this is a real spectrum of Earth
and that's how we're going to help to find life in the future but there's one
thing here and that is planets we've found so far we don't see them in a lot
of detail like this image but we know they're very different from each other
planets come in all sizes all masses all the different weapons and we actually
like to say exoplanets that anything is possible within the laws of physics and
chemistry
so given that planets have such huge variety
do you think that the first one we get to see is going to look just like Earth
so that's my job as a professor or scientist
I think hard about problems and i'm trying to think through which molecules
should be how we gonna do this you know we're gonna build a complicated Space
Telescope and spend a lot of money we want to know what we're looking for and
it's very hard to think that deeply that outside of the box and you know how
sometimes when you're working really hard
take a break check your email well you know what it almost every day like many
times a week when i checked my email i get a crazy theory from someone there i
don't know if this happens to anybody here but someone has usually a very out
about some new law of physics or their view of the world so please don't email
me your crazy theory that I was working on this problem and I started to realize
that from my view it seems like any gas could conceivably be indicative of life
if it was produced in high enough quantities because life on earth
produces thousands of gases and thousands of gases and which ones will
you know accumulate and exist in large quantities in an exoplanet we don't know
yet because the conditions could be very different life on those other planets
may produce very different things
and here on earth much her life produces gases for no apparent reason
and so with all that together I came up with my own crazy theory and in this
theory I really thought that life produced also molecules every small
molecule that I could think of nitrogen carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
carbon dioxide oxygen and you know those are very small ones but even bigger ones
i could think of and I thought wow I can't believe this
what if the series correct what would even mean so I recruited a couple of
biochemistry colleagues we worked on this theory and then what would I do i
emailed
come from better and I think he's a Nobel laureate actually in physiology or
medicine and I said well can I come and tell you about my theory and he actually
knew me I wasn't just a random you know you know writer and he said ok so i take
my friends and we go there over across the river to see him and immediately he
said this is not right and he pointed out a counter example of a molecule
that's just not produce my life
so we went back to the drawing board we worked on it for another year and we
found something pretty I thought very something that appears to be very
amazing and that is life seems to produce nearly in produces a large
fraction of molecules of they're not all standalone molecules that means they
won't exist on their own but they appear to exist as substructures of other
molecules and what my team found was that some of these uh that are not
produced by life following two very distinct categories so life seems to
produce many molecules just not all of them are standalone and the ones that
life doesn't produce they actually may tell us something very useful about the
limits of terrestrial biochemistry and it may eventually have applications to
toxicology or even in pharmaceutical drug discovery that was a little aside
to just give you a bit of flavor of of working as a scientist on exoplanets
but back to exoplanets and atmospheres I was just going to show you the list of
what I started to do my work
I literally wrote a computer code to combine all the important biogenic
elements in any combination possible and we we have got this huge lesson ends up
being so long I almost didn't know what to do about it but thanks for you know
computer programming and computers and Python language especially were able to
make a lot of progress on this this problem you can see some molecules and
this is actually only a tiny amount of them because some molecular formula
there's no molecular structure that matches that formula other formula
there are many different incarnations depending on where the
atoms are so you can get lots of them and in the end we almost have a list now
I think it's like twenty thousand molecules to work with and that's
actually what I'm working on now is how do we handle the fact that life produces
so many different molecules and on an exoplanet far away
we don't know yet which molecules could be the ones produced by life that
accumulate in the atmosphere but I just want you to know we're working on this
and i have this cartoon to show you that we have thousands of molecules and we
want to sort of filter them out which ones are not likely to accumulate which
ones would not have a spectroscopic line like the ones I showed you in the solar
spectrum which ones may also produce by volcanoes and so we're working through
this right now to see what is what is a possibility and what we should be
looking for
so I get the question all the time about why study exoplanet heads when we have a
lot of problems here
why are we doing this why why should we care and one of my my answers is as as
as from a scientific perspective as well we have this natural curiosity about the
world around us and we'd like to understand where Darth come from
how did our solar system form and evolve
why is our planet so far anyway the only one with life but and natural and
scientific curiosity inevitably leads to breakthroughs that were never
anticipated like the laser or GPS we didn't set out to make gps so that we
can all figure out how to navigate your that came from a big history of people
curious about building rockets to us being able to launch spacecraft into low
Earth orbit repeatedly and even the Hubble Space Telescope has many spin-off
applications including medical imaging one of my favorite reasons for studying
exoplanets has to do with Space engineering exoplanets are so small and
so faint and so left massive than their bright adjacent co-star that all of the
telescopes that we build and ones were working to be able to find and identify
another earth are very very complicated and as a nation we can't show the world
are what we can do in space through our defense technologies which we keep
hidden
instead after civilian space science we can showcase our technical progress and
it's not only that but the sort of ability to define think about and solve
very big complex scientific and technological problems is what we need
to be doing to maintain our technological leadership and to train
the next generation and and inspire them but for me my real reason for studying
exoplanets is just one of exploration and here now we're zooming out away from
a thousand light-years out to what we think our Milky Way galaxy looks like
with hundreds of billions of stars and highlighted are just the planets the
stars with planets we know about already and this is our frontier for me it's a
journey of exploration we dream big because we can and we explore because
that's part of what it means to be human
thank you for your attention
yeah
