I couldn't begin to enumerate tell you the time 
when things have happened in life 
which you could attribute to coincidence if you wish 
but for the improbability grows fast would you like me to tell you about one 
I think he rarely do that dnmt but I will because 
as you know I have been a mop to Russia 
how did I come to go to Russia well intended 
I was at a conference of mathematical cryptographers 
but nndb abandoned them so don't laugh dnmt 
never use 
yeah little mathematical cryptographer 
right inside the box connecting 
I'm dnmt 
it was a bunch of mostly from is the conference on the bus driver lost his way to the station and witnessed the frame 
so there were fifty very angry mathematician steinn in Belgium 
under the and we got on the train and I was going to Cologne and was late at night I was a bit concerned anatomy suitcase 
and in those days 
Cologne station wasn't the best place to be found after midnight 
so I find myself in a compartment 
well 
a German 
a Belgian and to Russia 
and I sub aside the Russian I started to talk to nobody was rather surprised I can speak a bit of his language 
and I said what do you do the settlement colleges 
Alicia ecologists do they have those in Russia dnmt 
yes I come from 
you should tell you openly talk about 
he said well you know we can say that 
and then I said to my other other things that you can talk about it openly that were taboo earlier he said like what I said like gold for example 
and he said yes we could talk about god in that moment 
the thought came into my head 
I've got to give this man a Bible 
Korea spoke to governor Frank going through Benjamin the middle of the night 
and I kept talking to him couldn't get it out of my head and in the end the fall through so strong I thought this is crazy I mean what do you get a Bible from in the middle of the night right balance 
and then I had another thought 
I thought I wonder system there 
three weeks before that I'd been in Germany when the publisher 
sitting on his desk was a Russian by 
and I said that's a nice privately said you wanted by concrete and I said I love it mine is pretty old night like that so I put it in my suitcase 
I wonder is it still there so when the still talking the shop I got out 
put my hand into the suitcase and the Bible still there 
so I brought it out and I handed it 
he wants us quite easily 
he couldn't speak 
and I thought he was gonna have a heart attack nnat I said what's wrong with you nnat thing and then he said puppy was not only a 
how did you know that 
should what do you mean how did I know 
he said how did you know that six weeks ago the only Bible we've ever seen still 
India clutched inside there 
and we just got an opportunity to come to the west 
and for the first time we're taking the place playing to Moscow 
how did you know 
also do you believe this 
he said I don't know but he said look at the corner that's my wife she believes 
and I tried and I never forget it 
the scene this young woman with her face glowing the tears streaming down her face as she clutched the Bible 
and she said it's not really for me 
are you really giving 
and they were bought and the like 
and the German girl said to me 
she said the fat often happen dnmt 
but 
I said you shouldn't 
I mean it's virtually wiped out 
I said look 
this person comes from a country where the been systematically 
denied access to the 
if this really is the word 
usually as a postman 
as much as anybody else when she said I'd better if you did 
and we carried on the corresponding 
well 
what do you make of the story 
suddenly I Gotto 
told my wife 
she said let me see your diary 
she did something she's never done under like 
Orson 
she said clear your diary for at least two months 
pardon 
she said you're going to Russia 
he said how would you go to Russia 
well I said it's a very complicated business you've got a regular role society Finland and less forms and so on she said bring them 
what I said props nudge me right now so Mogens does what he's told 
fineness at the man at the end says professor Lennox 
you want to go to Russia 
when can you go alone can you go for 
I'm 
we want the Russian mathematicians like it's a week for a week can you go for a month I should my wife says tell you he said but I'm no forms you get the money you can leave tomorrow if you want 
what I got to rush in the 
middle of the academy of science 
all they wanted to know was higher than a person like me
